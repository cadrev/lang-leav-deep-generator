I watch the way your hands move as you tell your joke and laugh a little too loudly when you deliver the punch line.</p><p class="calibre_10">His eyes flash at me from across the table. The same disapproving look he shot me earlier, as I was getting dressed.</p><p class="calibre_10">It’s a bit tight.</p><p class="calibre_10">Don’t be ridiculous, I say.</p><p class="calibre_10">How do you know him, again?</p><p class="calibre_10">Just an old friend. We worked together years ago.</p><p class="calibre_10">He clears his throat, breaking my reverie. My grin fades into a small, restrained smile.</p><p class="calibre_10">You top up his glass.</p><p class="calibre_10">The conversation drifts into stocks and bonds. My mind begins to wander, like a bored schoolgirl.</p><p class="calibre_10">Your hand brushes my leg.</p><p class="calibre_10">Was it an accident? I look at you questioningly, but you are staring straight ahead, engrossed in conversation.</p><p class="calibre_10">Then there it is again. Very deliberately, resting on my knee.</p><p class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">Oh, your hands.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_10">They slide up my thigh and under my skirt, lightly skimming the fabric of my panties.</p><p class="calibre_10"><span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">It’s been so long.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_10">I part my legs under the table.</p><p class="calibre_10">The conversation turns to politics.</p><p class="calibre_10">A mirror effect, you say.</p><p class="calibre_10">He looks confused. What’s this about mirrors?</p><p class="calibre_10">The word sends a jolt through my body.</p><p class="calibre_10">Your hand slips into my panties. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_45"></div>
