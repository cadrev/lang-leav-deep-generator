In many such scenarios, I have slipped into these roles with the greatest of ease<span class="calibre2">—</span>then out again with the same dexterity. </p><p class="calibre_10">That was until I found myself in character, playing the girl who falls in love with you. It was then the line between fantasy and reality were so blurred that I no longer knew who I was. </p><p class="calibre_10">Yet, there was clearly a point when my role was well and truly over. When I had gone above and beyond the required word count. Where I had exhausted every new angle or approach there was to writing our story. </p><p class="calibre_10">I know it’s over, I really do. I know it has been for quite some time. It’s over, yet my heart still feels you. You are a memory to me now, but my mind still thinks of you. What we had was finished long ago<span class="calibre2">—</span>yet the words will not stop flowing. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_85"></div>
