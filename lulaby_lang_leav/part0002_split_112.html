			<p class="prose_body2">Do you know when you’ve lost something<span class="em-dash2">—</span>like your favorite t-shirt or a set of keys<span class="em-dash2">—</span>and while looking for it, you come across something else you once missed but have long since forgotten? Well whatever it was, there was a point where you decided to stop searching, maybe because it was no longer required or a new replacement was found. It is almost as if it never existed in the first place<span class="em-dash2">—</span>until that moment of rediscovery, a flash of recognition. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Everyone has one<span class="em-dash2">—</span>an inventory of lost things waiting to be found. Yearning to be acknowledged for the worth they once held in your life. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">I think this is where I belong<span class="em-dash2">—</span>among all your other lost things. A crumpled note at the bottom of a drawer or an old photograph pressed between the pages of a book. I hope someday you will find me and remember what I once meant to you. </p>
