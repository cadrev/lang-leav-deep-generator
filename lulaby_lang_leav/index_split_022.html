My indecision. I wanted everything because I didn’t want anything enough. </p><p class="calibre_10">Then I met you and it changed me. For once in my life, there was something I wanted. So much. </p><p class="calibre_10">For me, that was the death of the word, <span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">or;</span></span> because now, there is no other.
