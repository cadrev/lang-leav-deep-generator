<blockquote class="calibre_"><blockquote class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre2">Despondency</span></blockquote><a id="filepos78724"></a></blockquote><p class="calibre_10">There was a girl named Despondency, who loved a boy named Altruistic, and he loved her in return. </p><p class="calibre_10">She adored books and he could not read, so they spent most of their time wandering through worlds together and in doing so, lived many lives. </p><p class="calibre_10">One day, they read the last book there was and decided they would write their own. It was a beautiful tale set against a harsh desert with a prince named Mirage as the hero. From their wild imaginings, an intricate plot of adventure and tragedy unfolded. </p><p class="calibre_10">Altruistic awoke one night to find Despondency sitting at her desk, furiously scribbling away in their book. It caught him by surprise for until now, she had not written a single word without him.</p><p class="calibre_10">Despondency turned to face him, her eyes cast downward. She told him while writing their story, she had fallen desperately in love with Prince Mirage and wanted to wander the desert in search of him. </p><p class="calibre_10">Altruistic was heartbroken but knew it was in Despondency’s nature to long for what she couldn’t have, just like it was in his not to stand in her way. Crying, she begged him to burn the tale of Prince Mirage, but he could not bring himself to do it. </p><p class="calibre_10">They said their good-byes and she asked him if he would carry their book with him always. He promised he would and with one final look, she was swallowed by the swirling desert sands. He knew he would never see her again. </p><blockquote class="calibre_"><blockquote class="calibre_7"><span class="calibre2">Epilogue </span></blockquote><a id="filepos80554"></a></blockquote><p class="calibre_10">The girl was standing in the graveyard by her father’s tombstone when a tall stranger approached. Handing her a worn, leather-bound book, he said, “Your father wanted you to have this.” She knew at once it was the book he had carried in his breast pocket, close to his heart for all his life. Her father’s inability to read was also something she had inherited, and while tracing her fingers over the cover of the book, she asked, “Can you please tell me what the title is?” </p><p class="calibre_10">“Grief.” the stranger replied. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_61"></div>
