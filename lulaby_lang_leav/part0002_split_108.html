			<p class="prose_body2"><span class="charoverride12">Do you know that feeling? When it’s like you’ve lost something but can’t remember what it was.

You’ve said it a thousand times before and it was always there</span><span class="em-dash2">—</span><span class="charoverride12">right where you left it. But now you can’t recall it. You try and try to make it appear and it almost does, but it never does.</span></p>
			<p class="prose_body2"><span class="charoverride12">There are times when I think it could surface</span><span class="em-dash2">—</span><span class="charoverride12">when I sense it at the tip of my tongue. When I feel it struggling to burst from my chest like a beach ball that can only be held beneath the water for so long. </span></p>
			<p class="prose_body2"><span class="charoverride12">I can feel it stirring each time someone hurts me. When I smile at a stranger and they don’t smile back. When I trust someone with a secret and they betray me. When someone I admire tells me I am not good enough. </span></p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I don’t know what it is or what I have lost. But I know it was important, I know it once made me happy. </p>
