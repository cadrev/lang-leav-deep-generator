She wrote his name on the inside of her pencil case. Hoping he might ask to borrow a pen so she could be found out. </p><p class="calibre_10">In the yard of a house where she lived, there was a large oak tree carved with the initials of each boy she had ever kissed. She put a cross next to the letters F.P. and noticed with a quiet wonder that he shared the same initials as The Frog Prince. </p><p class="calibre_10">She loved only him.</p><p class="calibre_10">Like Rapunzel, she grew her hair longer than anyone she knew and for nearly a whole summer, she slept and slept and slept.
