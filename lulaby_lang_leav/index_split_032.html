The glass bottle does not know its own contents. It has no idea whether it is a vessel for the most delicious apple cider, a lovingly crafted wine, or a bitter poison. People are the same. Yet like the bottle, we are transparent. We can’t see ourselves the way others see us.   </p><p class="calibre_10">How do you see me? she asked.</p><p class="calibre_10">You are a bottle floating out at sea, he says. One that contains a very important message. It may never reach its recipient, but as long as there is someone waiting, it will always have purpose.</p><p class="calibre_10">Will you wait for mine?</p><p class="calibre_10">I will, he promised. I will look for you every time I stand at the edge of the ocean.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>
