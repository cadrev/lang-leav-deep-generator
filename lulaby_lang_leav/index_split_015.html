Patience arrived promptly and waited. She checked her watch every so often but still, there was no sign of Love. </p><p class="calibre_10">Was it the twenty-third tree or the fifty-sixth? She wondered and decided to check, just in case. As she made her way over to the fifty-sixth tree, Love arrived at twenty-three, where Patience was noticeably absent. </p><p class="calibre_10">Love waited and waited before deciding he must have the wrong tree and perhaps it was another where they were supposed to meet. </p><p class="calibre_10">Meanwhile, Patience had arrived at the fifty-sixth tree, where Love was still nowhere to be seen. </p><p class="calibre_10">Both begin to drift aimlessly around the olive orchard, almost meeting but never do. </p><p class="calibre_10">Finally, Patience, who was feeling lost and resigned, found herself beneath the same tree where she began. She stood there for barely a minute when there was a tap on her shoulder. </p><p class="calibre_10">It was Love. </p><p class="calibre_10">..................................</p><p class="calibre_10">“Where are you?” She asked. “I have been searching all my life.”<br class="calibre1"/> “Stop looking for me,” Love replied, “and I will find you.” </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_15"></div>
