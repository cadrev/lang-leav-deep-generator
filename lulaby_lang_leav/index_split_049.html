There are no photographs, no receipts, no scrawled journal entries. </p><p class="calibre_10">Just the memory sitting in my mind, like a half-blown dandelion, waiting to be fractured, dismembered. Waiting to disintegrate into nothing.</p><p class="calibre_10">As I close my eyes, the pictures play like a blurry montage. I can see us driving for hours, until the street signs grew less familiar<span class="calibre2">—</span>the flickering lamplights giving away to stars. Then sitting across from you in that quiet, little Italian place. Your hands pushing the plates aside, reaching across for mine. </p><p class="calibre_10">The conversations we had about everything and nothing. And kissing you. How I remember that. </p><p class="calibre_10">It was one of those nights that my mind still can’t be sure of. That wonders if I was ever there at all. Yet in my heart, it is as though I’ve never left. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_49"></div>
