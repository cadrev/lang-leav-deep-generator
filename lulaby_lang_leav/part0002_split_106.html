			<p class="prose_body2"><span class="charoverride12">I would often wonder about his playlist and the ghosts who lived there. The faces he saw and the voices he heard. The soundtrack to a thousand tragic endings, real or imagined. </span></p>
			<p class="prose_body2"><span class="charoverride12">The first time I saw him, I noticed how haunted his eyes were. And I was drawn to him, in the way a melody draws a crowd to the dance floor. Pulled by invisible strings. </span></p>
