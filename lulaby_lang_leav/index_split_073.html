How the words spoke to him like poetry. </p><p class="calibre_10">I would often wonder about his playlist and the ghosts who lived there. The faces he saw and the voices he heard. The soundtrack to a thousand tragic endings, real or imagined. </p><p class="calibre_10">The first time I saw him, I noticed how haunted his eyes were. And I was drawn to him, in the way a melody draws a crowd to the dance floor. Pulled by invisible strings. </p><p class="calibre_10">Now I wonder if I am one of those ghosts<span class="calibre2">â€”</span>if I am somewhere, drifting between those notes. I hope I am. I hope whenever my song plays, I am there, whispering in his ear.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_73"></div>
