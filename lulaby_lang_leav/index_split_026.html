Representations of good or bad. Like an old friend you see across a crowded street, one you wave hello to, before hurrying on. The last time you saw them, things took a turn for the worse and, as sad as it may seem, they have unwittingly become an omen<span class="calibre2">—</span>a precursor of bad luck. </p><p class="calibre_10">Or that one person whom you rarely speak with, who can always be found right where you left them. You carry their smile with you like a talisman<span class="calibre2">—</span>for whatever reason, their presence in your life will always bring the promise of better days. </p><p class="calibre_10">Then there is the boy you can never stop thinking about. Whenever you see his name, it trips you up. Even if it’s one that belongs to many others, even if he belongs to someone else. </p><p class="calibre_10">You know he is a symbol of your weakness, your Kryptonite. How he rushes in like wildfire and burns through everything you worked so hard to build since he last left you in ashes. </p><p class="calibre_10">So you do the only thing you know how<span class="calibre2">—</span>you put as many miles as you can between him. As many roadblocks and traffic lights as you can gather. Then you build a bold red stop sign right on your doorstep, knowing all the stop signs in the world could never hold him<span class="calibre2">—</span>they can only ask him to stay awhile.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_26"></div>
