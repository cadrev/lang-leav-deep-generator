			<p class="prose_body2">I am somebody else’s story. The girl who served their drink, the person they pushed past on a crowded street, the one who broke their heart. I have happened in so many places, to so many people<span class="em-dash2">—</span>the essence of me lives on in these nuances, these moments. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Yet never have I been bolder or brighter than I am with you. Not once have I ever felt so alive. Whatever vessel we pour ourselves into, mine is now overflowing, brimming with life. It is transcending into something new. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Hands are no longer hands. They are caresses. Mouths are no longer mouths. They are kisses. My name is no longer a name, it is a call. And love is no longer love<span class="em-dash2">—</span>love is you. </p>
