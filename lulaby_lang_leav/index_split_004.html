All artists have a motive, a passion that wills them to create the things they do. For me, it has always been about books. It always will be. </p><p class="calibre_10">It was from a very young age that I fell in love with this wonderful artifact<span class="calibre2">—</span>the turn of the first page is almost like a sacred ritual to me. Whenever I walk into a library, it is never without some degree of reverence. </p><p class="calibre_10">Over time, my love of books spilled beyond the joy of reading and I began to dream of books filled with my own words and pictures. </p><p class="calibre_10">This dream turned to reality with the publication of my first book, <span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">Love &amp; Misadventure</span></span>, and continues now with the follow-up, <span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">Lullabies</span></span>, the very book you are holding in your hands. </p><p class="calibre_10">I have always thought poems were a little like spells<span class="calibre2">—</span>incantations that are as old as time. There is a certain quality to words that<span class="calibre2">—</span>when strung in a certain way<span class="calibre2">—</span>has an almost hypnotic effect. This combined with the universal theme of love, becomes ever more potent and intoxicating. After all, what greater magic is there than love?</p><p class="calibre_10">I hope you enjoy reading <span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">Lullabies</span></span> as much as I enjoyed putting it together. I imagine it to be a bedside table kind of book<span class="calibre2">—</span>hopefully, one that you will pick up on some windy, restless night and it will help sing you to sleep. </p><p class="calibre_10">Though it has a start, middle, and end, you can begin reading <span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">Lullabies</span></span> from any page you wish. Some pieces will sing to your present, others may echo of your past, and the rest could whisper of your future. Remember, while the words on these pages remain static, this book<span class="calibre2">—</span>like all other books<span class="calibre2">—</span>is a living and breathing thing. Much like a mirror reflecting its ever-changing landscape, <span class="calibre2"><span class="italic">Lullabies</span></span> is a book that, over time, will reveal itself to you slowly. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_"><blockquote class="calibre_7">Much Love, <br class="calibre1"/> Lang</blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_11">
