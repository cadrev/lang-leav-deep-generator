When it’s like you’ve lost something but can’t remember what it was. It’s as though you’re trying so desperately to think of a word but it won’t come to you. You’ve said it a thousand times before and it was always there<span class="calibre2">—</span>right where you left it. But now you can’t recall it. You try and try to make it appear and it almost does, but it never does.</p><p class="calibre_10">There are times when I think it could surface<span class="calibre2">—</span>when I sense it at the tip of my tongue. When I feel it struggling to burst from my chest like a beach ball that can only be held beneath the water for so long. </p><p class="calibre_10">I can feel it stirring each time someone hurts me. When I smile at a stranger and they don’t smile back. When I trust someone with a secret and they betray me. When someone I admire tells me I am not good enough. </p><p class="calibre_10">I don’t know what it is or what I have lost. But I know it was important, I know it once made me happy. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_92"></div>
