One day you meet someone and for some inexplicable reason, you feel more connected to this stranger than anyone else<span class="calibre2">—</span>closer to them than your closest family. Perhaps because this person carries an angel within them<span class="calibre2">—</span>one sent to you for some higher purpose, to teach you an important lesson or to keep you safe during a perilous time. What you must do is trust in them<span class="calibre2">—</span>even if they come hand in hand with pain or suffering<span class="calibre2">—</span>the reason for their presence will become clear in due time.</p><p class="calibre_10">Though here is a word of warning<span class="calibre2">—</span>you may grow to love this person but remember they are not yours to keep. Their purpose isn’t to save you but to show you how to save yourself. And once this is fulfilled, the halo lifts and the angel leaves their body as the person exits your life. They will be a stranger to you once more.</p><p class="calibre_10">..................................</p><p class="calibre_10">It’s so dark right now, I can’t see any light around me.<br class="calibre1"/>That’s because the light is coming from you. You can’t see it but everyone else can.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_118"></div>
