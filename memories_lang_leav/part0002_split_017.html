			<p class="prose_body1">She was the sound of glass shattering<span class="em-dash2">â€”</span>the sharp ringing in your ears. The perpetual motion of a spinning ballerina trapped inside a music box. The sad, tinny tune of La Vie en Rose. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">She was the zigzag in your straight line. The absence in your direction. She was every turn you took when racing through a hedge maze, against the setting sun. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">She was the tide that came in and out, like the breath of the wounded. She was the blood that flowed between heart and head. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">She was the book that was not written. The sentence that was not scripted. She was the word you wished you could have said.</p>
