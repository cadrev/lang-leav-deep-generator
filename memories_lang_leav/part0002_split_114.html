			<p class="prose_body2">Patience and Love agreed to meet at a set time and place; beneath the twenty-third tree in the olive orchard. Patience arrived promptly and waited. She checked her watch every so often but still, there was no sign of Love. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Was it the twenty-third tree or the fifty-sixth? She wondered and decided to check, just in case. As she made her way over to the fifty-sixth tree, Love arrived at twenty-three, where Patience was noticeably absent. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Love waited and waited before deciding he must have the wrong tree and perhaps it was another where they were supposed to meet. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Meanwhile, Patience had arrived at the fifty-sixth tree, where Love was still nowhere to be seen. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Both begin to drift aimlessly around the olive orchard, almost meeting but never do. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Finally, Patience, who was feeling lost and resigned, found herself beneath the same tree where she began. She stood there for barely a minute when there was a tap on her shoulder. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">It was Love. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2"><span class="charoverride11">..................................</span></p>
			<p class="prose_body2">“Where are you?” she asked. “I have been searching all my life.”</p>
			<p class="prose_bodyb1">“Stop looking for me,” Love replied, “and I will find you.” </p>
