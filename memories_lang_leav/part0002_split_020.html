			<p class="prose_body1">Do you think of me on airplanes? With your headphones snug around your ears and the clouds below? Do you think of my hands as you are exploring new territory<span class="em-dash2">—</span>the freedom, the thrill, the rush? When you travel against the turn of our planet, does it take you back into the past?</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I think of you on jet planes. In thoughts that go a million miles an hour. Over toy towns and towers made of tin. Nothing feels real without you.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">Do you think of what could have been? In the early morning light when you wake up next to some stranger, wondering why you don’t feel a thing. In every bar room and bedroom where you’re forced into conversation or giving away parts of yourself<span class="em-dash2">—</span>do you miss me? </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">Do you think of me in cars? When every turn you take is driving us further apart. Does every road sign pleading you to take care, remind you of how much I want you, how deeply you are loved?</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I think of you on roads that stretch into the horizon. On roundabouts and signs that keep telling me I am going in the wrong direction. I hope you think of me as much as I think of you. I hope that every step will bring you closer, that every dead end is a messenger, willing you to turn back around, reminding you it’s time to come home.</p>
