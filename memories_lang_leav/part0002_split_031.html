			<p class="prose_body1">I know my being happy is an anomaly. No one knows me better than you. But I can say without avoiding your gaze, without crossing my fingers behind my back; or the other things I do when speaking untruthfully<span class="em-dash2">—</span>I am happy. I know the rain does not discriminate between day or night and either will hold its own light and dark<span class="em-dash2">—</span>but now, at this very moment, I feel like I am the sun. And I know in my heart, I will always look upon this time<span class="em-dash2">—</span>not without a sense of melancholy<span class="em-dash2">—</span>that it was the happiest in my life.</p>
