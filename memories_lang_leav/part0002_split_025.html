			<p class="prose_body1">I wrote a poem about a girl who loves you. I said a soliloquy that was spoken in her honor. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I felt every word that burst from her lips, like shooting stars, into the air around us. If it were possible to hold love in your hand, it was her hand that trembled as I held it. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I could taste her tears that ran like rain on windshields. The kind that searched with longing, for lonely drop after drop, to form a pool of forlorn belonging.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I wrote this poem for the girl who loves you<span class="em-dash2">â€”</span>for she loves you more than I love you. Because she is sorry and so am I.</p>
