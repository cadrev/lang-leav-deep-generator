			<p class="attribute"><span class="em-dash1">—</span>Michael Faudet</p>
			<p class="prose_body1"><span class="charoverride8">Memories</span> is a collection of poetry and prose, hand selected from my two previous books, <span class="charoverride8">Love &amp; Misadventure</span> and <span class="charoverride8">Lullabies</span>. It also features some new writing I have completed over the last year.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">My intention was to create a book that is enduring, one that could be kept as a keepsake or given to someone special in your life.  </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I have always thought of memories as fragments, like colored glass shards in a kaleidoscope. It is the source of great beauty in our lives, yet the cause of such heartache. It remains the bridge between our past and present<span class="em-dash2">—</span>it gives weight and dimension to our very existence. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I hope you enjoy <span class="charoverride8">Memories</span> as much as I enjoyed putting it together. I know there are many great moments that are yet to transpire for you. I hope in time, you will find echoes of them in this book. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Much love, </p>
