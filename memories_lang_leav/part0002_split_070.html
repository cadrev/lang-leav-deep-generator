			<p class="prose_body2">Here are the things I want for you.</p>
			<p class="prose_body2">I want you to be happy. I want someone else to know the warmth of your smile, to feel the way I did when I was in your presence. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">I want you to know how happy you once made me and though you really did hurt me, in the end, I was better for it. I don’t know if what we had was love, but if it wasn’t, I hope never to fall in love. Because of you, I know I am too fragile to bear it. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">I want you to remember my lips beneath your fingers and how you told me things you never told another soul. I want you to know that I have kept sacred, everything you had entrusted in me and I always will. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Finally, I want you to know how sorry I am for pushing you away when I had only meant to bring you closer. And if I ever felt like home to you, it was because you were safe with me. I want you to know that most of all. </p>
