			<p class="prose_body1">One day he will find you. He will touch you and you will feel a lifetime of indifference<span class="em-dash2">—</span>of apathy melt away in a single moment. And you will ache for him. You will love him, in the way you walk a tightrope<span class="em-dash2">—</span>in the way people learn to fall asleep in a war zone. You will bleed for him until the day he is gone. You will bleed for him every day after that. The time will pass and you will feel robbed<span class="em-dash2">—</span>and you will grow bitter. You will ask why, but you won’t get an answer. And that is when the words will come.</p>
