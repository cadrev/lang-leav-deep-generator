			<p class="poem_body4">It’s been some time since I’ve felt lonely,</p>
			<p class="poem_body_indent">	like a book that is no longer read;</p>
			<p class="poem_body_indent">	the darkness lingers on without you,</p>
			<p class="poem_body_indent">	it fills my empty heart with dread. </p>
			<p class="poem_body4">It seems an age ago, since you have left me,</p>
			<p class="poem_body_indent">	time has filled me, with words unsaid;</p>
			<p class="poem_body_indent">	as the sadness seeps into me slowly,</p>
			<p class="poem_body_indent">	and I am left to face the night ahead.</p>
