			<p class="prose_body1">I was always meant for you. With my tennis shoes and wild hair, dragging a case with a cello hidden between its velvet walls. Even then. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I was always meant for you. In my black woolen dress and sapphire studs. Between hotel rooms and standing ovations. Even now.  </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I was never meant for road signs with foreign names, or lovers who spoke in exotic tongues. For maps that were composed in a language I could not read and printed in a dialect I could not write. </p>
