			<p class="prose_body2">I love him and he loves me.</p>
			<p class="prose_body2">We spend every moment together. When sleep parts us, we often meet in our dreams. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">I like to take naps throughout the day. <span class="italic2">Like a cat</span>, he says. He is a cat person. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">He thinks my eyes are beautiful and strange. He has never seen eyes like mine up close before. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">He says they look at him with daggers when he has done something wrong. Like when he forgets to order olives on my half of the pizza. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">He thinks I am especially cute when angry.</p>
			<p class="prose_body2">We argue over whose turn it is to put the DVD in the player. Sometimes no one wins and we end up watching bad TV. Which is never really a bad thing.</p>
			<p class="prose_body2">He never imagined he would be with someone like me. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2">Now, he says, he can’t imagine himself with anyone else. </p>

			<p class="prose_body2">We’re kids, aren’t we?</p>
			<p class="prose_bodyb1">Yes, kids with grown-up powers. </p>
