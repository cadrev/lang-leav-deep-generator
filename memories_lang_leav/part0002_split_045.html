			<p class="prose_body1">When two souls fall in love, there is nothing else but the yearning to be close to the other. The presence that is felt through a hand held, a voice heard, or a smile seen. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">Souls do not have calendars or clocks, nor do they understand the notion of time or distance. They only know it feels right to be with one another.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">This is the reason why you miss someone so much when they are not there<span class="em-dash2">—</span>even if they are only in the very next room. Your soul only feels their absence<span class="em-dash2">—</span>it doesn’t realize the separation is temporary. </p>
