			<p class="prose_body1">I don’t know what it is like to love someone who the world tells me I am not supposed to love. I can’t imagine how hard it must be to love someone I am afraid to kiss on the street. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">But I do know what it is like to love someone who I cannot be with. I know how it feels to have my brain tell me one thing, and my heart another. I know how hard it is to have to love someone in secret. To live with the knowledge that if circumstances had been different, I would be with the one I love. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I do know there are all kinds of barriers to love. I do believe the world needs less of them.</p>
