			<p class="prose_body1">I have given so much to things that weren’t worth my time. When all along, it’s the people I love that I should have carried. It’s the ones I cared for whom I should have been responsible. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">But maybe I’m too late. Because I don’t know how to talk to you. I don’t know how to ask you if you’re okay. I don’t know how to tell you I am so afraid of losing you. How much light would leave my life if you were no longer part of it.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I just hope you realize how much you mean to me. I just wish I could remind you of how beautiful you are. I’m sorry I haven’t told you in so long. But please don’t think I have given up on you. I will never give up on you. My arms are wide open. There is always a place for you here.</p>
