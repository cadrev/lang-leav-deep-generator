			<p class="prose_body1">As the Earth began spinning faster and faster, we floated upwards, hands locked tightly together, eyes sad and bewildered. We watched as our faces grew younger and realized the Earth was spinning in reverse, moving us backwards in time. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">Then we reached a point where I no longer knew who you were and I was grasping the hands of a stranger. But I didn’t let go. And neither did you. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1"><span class="charoverride11">..................................</span></p>
			<p class="prose_bodyb1">I had my first dream about you last night.</p>
			<p class="prose_bodyb1">Really? She smiles. What was it about?</p>
			<p class="prose_bodyb1">I don’t remember exactly, but the whole time I was dreaming, I knew you were mine. </p>
