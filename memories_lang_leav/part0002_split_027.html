			<p class="prose_body1">Do you remember that night I turned up on your doorstep? I was wearing my Sunday best. You watched the mascara as it ran down like fault lines, and you knew I had blood on my lips. </p>
			<p class="prose_body2_indent">	<span class="italic2">I’m tired of running</span>, I said<span class="em-dash2">—</span></p>
			<p class="prose_body1">and the earth shook a little.   </p>
			<p class="prose_body2_indent">	<span class="italic2">So am I</span>, you replied</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">as it shook a little more.</p>
			<p class="prose_body2_indent">	<span class="italic2">I don’t want anyone else</span>, I whispered.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">And I felt myself crumble.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">You held out your arms and I was cracked porcelain. We looked at each other as we stood at the precipice. And I knew once I fell, I’d never stop falling. And everything before you would be time to kill. You said you were scared but you couldn’t ignore it. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">And that was the moment when we became real.</p>
