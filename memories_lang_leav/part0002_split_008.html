			<p class="prose_body1">Does it make you crazy? To think he saw you<span class="em-dash2">—</span>his eyes passed over you and if only there had been some small mishap in that pivotal moment. A spilled drink, a stumble through the door<span class="em-dash2">—</span>his hand reaching out to steady you and it would have happened. A whole new world would have opened up like a vortex to swallow you both into blissful delirium. But you turned away, out of shyness or indecision and by the time you turned back, he was gone. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">How do you explain it without sounding unsound? That click you felt when your eyes met his, like the switch of a train track, transporting you for one miraculous moment, to what might have been.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">Then reality intervenes and with a shake of your head, you tell yourself to stop chasing shadows. But I can tell you now<span class="em-dash2">—</span>what you felt was real<span class="em-dash2">—</span>and you must always listen to that click. For it is the sound of your fate beckoning. It is the voice of your destiny calling. Sometimes it only calls once. </p>
