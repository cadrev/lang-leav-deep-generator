			<p class="prose_body2">Have you ever felt it? That split second before the feeling catches the memory<span class="em-dash2">—</span>that small haven of neutrality, before the headlong crash into recognition. Your mind pulls him to the foreground like a snapped rubber band. And you think of the line he drew in the sand, the one you can’t seem to put a foot past. Like a tripwire, you’re afraid of the damage but you know you can’t keep standing still. And the world falls away and you’re exactly where you were on the last night you saw him, when he had his hands in your hair and his mouth on your neck and he never said a word about leaving.</p>
