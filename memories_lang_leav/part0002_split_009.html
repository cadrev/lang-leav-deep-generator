<p id="_idParaDest-8" class="prose_head">After the Storm </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">There are storms that change the skyline, that leave patches of blue where branches had once spread their brittle fingers. And in the aftermath, an eerie calm settles over the forest, as shell-shocked birds sing warily in the sunlight. The nervous flutter of their injured wings, barely audible above the hammering of a hummingbird’s heart.</p>
			<p class="prose_body1">You once told me the wind is silent. How his sound can only be heard through collision. Last night, he cried with a violent yearning while he tore through the trees. As he brought down their twisted branches, I thought of the first time you said my name. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">You were the storm that changed the skyline. After the damage and the deluge, I could see things so much clearer. There hasn’t been another like you since. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">In 1953, we began naming hurricanes so we could remember them beyond the wreckage. So we could try to make sense of the destruction. This is the way I remember you.</p>
