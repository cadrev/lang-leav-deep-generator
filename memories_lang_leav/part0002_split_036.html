			<p class="prose_body1">It was your opening line. I didn’t know it then, but my past, present, and future were set to collide. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">At the time, the collision felt like a gentle wake-up call. Like a lazy Sunday morning spent gently parting ways with sleep. But now when I look back, I see it for what it was<span class="em-dash2">—</span>alarm bells blaring at five a.m. and a plane I couldn’t miss. </p>
