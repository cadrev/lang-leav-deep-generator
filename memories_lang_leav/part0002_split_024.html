			<p class="prose_body1">I remember learning the alphabet. How those strange markings, alien and incoherent, grew more and more familiar, like the name of someone you love. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">The moment words found me, they burrowed themselves into my bones, they settled like dust in my lungs until I felt them every time I breathed in and out. I would place them side by side like fractals, in a myriad of verse. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">I remember learning your name, the strange jumble of letters that danced under my tongue, that leapt from my hungry mouth. Those four syllables that bit deep into my soul like poetry. I remember how I whispered them against your lips. </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">And you would say, <span class="italic2">this is how I am with you, with you. </span> </p>
			<p class="prose_body1">It was words that I fell for. In the end, it was words that broke my heart.</p>
