### Lang Leav Poem Generator Using Recurrent Neural Networks
A silly project on learning how to use Recurrent Neural Networks for generating sequential data. 
In this case, using Lang Leav's 3 books as a corpora for the network to generate Lang Leav-esque poem/statements.


The corpora.txt already contains the 3 books. In about 25 iterations, the network begins forming readable sentences. Adding  various poems similar to Lang Leav is still ongoing. Increasing the number text/poems for RNN will definitely improve the sequence generation of the model.
