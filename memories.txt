After You
If I wrote it in a book,
could I shelve it?
If I told of what you took,
would that help it?
If I will it,
can I un-feel it,
now Ive felt it?


Acceptance 
There are things I miss
that I shouldnt, 
and those I dont
that I should. 
Sometimes we want
what we couldnt
sometimes we love
who we could.


Sundays with Michael
I hold my breath and count to ten,
I stand and sit, then stand again. 
I cross and then uncross my legs,
the planes are flying overhead. 
The dial turns with every twist,
around the watch, around his wrist. 
Resting there with pen in hand,
who could ever understand?
The way he writes of all I dream,
things kind yet cruel and in-between,
where underneath those twisted trees,
a pretty girl fallen to her knees. 
Who could know the world weve spun?
I shrug my shoulders and hold my tongue. 
I hold my breath and count to ten,
I stand and sit, then stand again. 


Introduction
I am hopelessly in love with a memory. An echo from another time, another place.  
Michael Faudet
Memories is a collection of poetry and prose, hand selected from my two previous books, Love & Misadventure
and Lullabies. It also features some new writing I have completed over the last year.
My intention was to create a book that is enduring, one that could be kept as a keepsake
or given to someone special in your life.  
I have always thought of memories as fragments, like colored glass shards in a kaleidoscope. It is the
source of great beauty in our lives, yet the cause of such heartache. It remains the bridge between 
our past and presentit gives weight and dimension to our very existence. 
I hope you enjoy Memories as much as I enjoyed putting it together. I know there are many
great moments that are yet to transpire for you. I hope in time, you will find echoes of them in this book. 
Much love, 
Lang


Souls
When two souls fall in love, there is nothing else but the yearning to be close to the
other. The presence that is felt through a hand held, a voice heard, or a smile seen. 
Souls do not have calendars or clocks, nor do they understand the notion of time or distance. 
Theyonly know it feels right to be with one another.
This is the reason why you miss someone so much when they are not thereeven if they are
only in the very next room. 
Your soul only feels their absenceit doesnt realize the separation is temporary. 

Can I ask you something?
Anything. 
Why is it every time we say good night, it feels like good-bye?


Clocks
Here in time, 
you are mine; 
my heart has not 
sung louder. 
I do not know 
why I love you so
the clock knows not 
its hour. 
Yet it is clear, 
to all thats here,
that time is told 
by seeing. 
Even though 
clocks do not know, 
it is the reason 
for their being.


Dead Poets
Her poetry is written on the ghost of trees, whispered on the lips of lovers. 
As a little girl, she would drift in and out of libraries filled with dead poets and their
musky scent. She held them in her hands and breathed them in wanting so much
to be part of their world. It wasnt long before Emily began speaking to her,
then Sylvia and Katherine; their voices rang in unison,
haunting and beautiful. They told her one day her poetry would be
written on the ghost of trees  and whispered on the lips of lovers. 
But it would come at a price. 
There isnt a thing I would not gladly give, she thought, to join my idols on those dusty
shelves. To be immortal. 
As if reading her mind, the voices of the dead poets cried out in alarm and warned her
about the greatest heartache of allhow every stroke of pen thereafter would open the
same wound over and over again.
What is the cause of such great heartache? She asked. 
They heard the keen anticipation in her voice and were sorry for her. 
The greatest heartache comes from loving another soul, they said, beyond reason, 
beyond doubt, with no hope of salvation. It was on her sixteenth birthday 
that she first fell in love. 
With a boy who brought herred roses and white lies. 
When he broke her heart, she cried for days. Then hopeful,
she sat with a pen in her hand, poised over the blank white sheet, 
but it refused to draw blood.  Many birthdays came and went. 
One by one, she loved them and just as easily, they were lost to her. 
Somewhere amidst the carnations and forget-me-nots, between the lilacs and mistletoe 
she slowly learned about love. Little by little, 
her heart bloomed into a bouquet of hope and ecstasy, of tenderness and betrayal. 
Then she met you, and you brought her dandelions each day, 
so she would never want for wishes.
She looked deep into your eyes and saw the very best of herself reflected back. 
And she loved you, beyond reason, beyond doubt, and with no hope of salvation.  
When she felt your love slipping away from her, she knelt at the altar, 
before all the great poets and she begged. She no longer cared for poetry or immortality,
she only wanted you.   But all the dead poets could do was look on, helpless and
resigned while everything  she had ever wished for came
true in the cruelest possible way. She learned too late that poets are among the damned, 
cursed to commiserate over their loss, to reach with outstretched handsh ands 
that will never know the weight of what they seek.


A Writers Plea
Take me someplace where I can feel somethingI want
to give away my heart. Tell me his name
so I can know love when it speaks to me. 
Give me someone I can write about.



Dear Love
Love, he has abandoned me,
do with me as you will.
Love, he leftunceremoniously, 
why must I love him still?
The best of me I gave to him 
the years, the days, the hours. 
Precious little, in turn hed given, 
like dew to a wilting flower.
Love, he sheared away tenderly,  
my beauty, my strength, my mind,
the gifts that were bestowed to me 
were swallowed in his pride.  
Love, has he forgotten me? 
Please tell me what youve heard,
I guard his memory jealously 
with him Id placed my worth.


Collision 
Do you think I have slipped into a time warp?
It was your opening line. I didnt know it then, but my past, present, and future were set
to collide. 
At the time, the collision felt like a gentle wake-up call. Like a lazy Sunday morning
spent gentlyparting ways with sleep. But now when I look back, I see it for what it wasalarm
bells blaring at five a.m. and a plane I couldnt miss. 
I got lost in the day to day. I passed by prophets on the city streets with their
signs, warning me about the apocalypse. I never imagined it was walking right beside me,
holding my hand. Night after night, I looked into your eyes but never once did
they offer me a prelude to the destruction. 
Life went on without you. Of course, it did. Of course, it does. It was just an ending,
they tell me, not the end. 


Lost and Found
A sunken chest,
on the ocean ground,
to never be found
was where he found me.
There he stirred,
my every thought,
my every word,
so gently, so profoundly. 
Now I am kept,
from dreams I dreamt,
when once I slept,
so soundly. 


Reaching Out 
I have given so much to things that werent worth my time. When all along, its the people
I love that I should have carried. Its the ones I cared for whom I should have been responsible. 
But maybe Im too late. Because I dont know how to talk to you. I dont know how
to ask you if youre okay. I dont know how to tell you I am so afraid of losing you.
How much light would leave my life if you were no longer part of it.
I just hope you realize how much you mean to me. I just wish I could remind you
of how beautiful you are. Im sorry I havent told you in so long. But please dont
think I have given up on you. I will never give up on you. My arms are wide open. 
There is always a place for you here.


Her
There is so much history in the way he looks at her. In the way he says her
name. When they are together, there is a current that runs between them; 
like an electric charge on the verge of erupting into a perfect storm. 
I dont love her anymore, he says. 
And it is in the way he says the word herthat tells me otherwise. 


A Timeline
You and I
against a rule,
set for us by time.
A marker drawn
to show our end, 
etched into its line.
The briefest moment
shared with you
the longest
on my mind.


Beach Ball
Do you know that feeling? When its like youve lost something 
but cant remember what it was. 
Its as though youre trying so desperately to think of
a word but it wont come to you.
Youve said it a thousand times before and it was always
there right where you left it. 
But now you cant recall it. You try and try to make it appear and it almost does, 
but it never does. There are times when I think it could surface when 
I sense it at the tip of my tongue. 
When I feel it struggling to burst from my chest like a beach ball that can only 
be held beneath the water for so long. 
I can feel it stirring each time someone hurts me. 
When I smile at a stranger and they dont smile back. 
When I trust someone with a secret and they betray me. 
When someone I admire tells me I am not good enough. 
I dont know what it is or what I have lost. 
But I know it was important, I know it once made me happy.



Jealousy
It was the way 
you spoke about her. 

With animosity, regret, disdain 
and underneath it all
just a hint of pride. 


No Other 
There is someone I keep in my heartI love him and no one else. It is a love
that will only die with me.  
You may ask, death could be some time awaywhat if from now to then, you love someone new?
Well I can tell you, there is only one love. If any person claims to have loved twice
in all their lifethey have not loved at all.


Angels
It happens like this. One day you meet someone and for some inexplicable reason, you feel
more connectedto this stranger than anyone else closer to them than your closest family.
Perhaps because this person carries an angel within them 
one sent to you for some higher purpose,
to teach you an important lesson or to keep you safe during a perilous time.
What you must do is trust in themeven if they come hand in hand with pain
or suffering the reason for their presence will become clear in due time.
Though here is a word of warning you may grow to love this person but remember they are not
yours to keep. Their purpose isnt to save you but to show you how to save yourself.
And once this is fulfilled,
the halo lifts and the angel leaves their body as the person exits your life.
They will be a stranger to you once more.

Its so dark right now, I cant see any light around me.
Thats because the light is coming from you. You cant see it but everyone else can.



She was the sound of glass shatteringthe sharp ringing in your ears. The perpetual motion
of a spinning ballerina trapped inside a music box. The sad, tinny tune of La Vie en Rose. 
She was the zigzag in your straight line. The absence in your direction. She was every turn you
took when racing through a hedge maze, against the setting sun. 
She was the tide that came in and out, like the breath of the wounded. She was the
blood that flowed between heart and head. 
She was the book that was not written. The sentence that was not scripted. She was the word
you wished you could have said.


Revelation 
Here is the place where you found me. Under the half-moon and its half-light. You said, if only
I had met you there that night. Perhaps we could have found our way.
I learned something about sadness after that day. 
You showed me insanity, as you promised you would.
Like an open window, seven storeys high. And it
was just as terrible and as beautiful as you and I.  
And you said ecstasy was a storm cloud, 
just before the rain would burst into the night sky,
like a thousand aquatic starsand not one single moment before.
And you were right. You were right about it all. 


A Bad Day
When thoughts of all but one,
are those I am keeping. 
When sore though there is none, 
for whom I am weeping. 
A curtain drawn before the sun,
and I wish to go on sleeping.


That Night
It was one of those nights that you are not altogether sure really did happen. There are no
photographs, no receipts, no scrawled journal entries. 
Just the memory sitting in my mind, like a half-blown dandelion, waiting to be fractured, dismembered.
Waiting to disintegrate into nothing.
As I close my eyes, the pictures play like a blurry montage. I can see us driving for
hours, until the street signs grew less familiarthe flickering lamplights giving away to stars.
Then sitting across from you in that quiet, little Italian place. Your hands pushing the plates aside,
reaching across for mine.   
The conversations we had about everything and nothing. And kissing you. How I remember that. 
It was one of those nights that my mind still cant be sure of. That wonders if I
was ever there at all. Yet in my heart, it is as though Ive never left.


First Love
Before I fell 
in love with words,
with setting skies
and singing birds
it was you I fell
in love with first.


In Love
Youve not yet had your heart in halves,
so little do you know of love
to tell me I will soon forget, 
there will be others to regret. 
Now all the years have proved you wrong,
my love for him burns bright and strong;
you cant divide the stars from night
from love there can be no respite.


Virtual Love
We fell in love through screens, through satellites that carried 
our words across the aching void.
Night after night, we spoke about hands on bodies and lips on skin. After the silence,
I would think of all the girls made of flesh and bone within your arms reach.
As winter gave way to summer, the dust motes dancing in the sunlight blurred into pixels,
and I gave my heart to a photograph. I wondered how I could be so afraid of 
losing something that wasnt mine. Then came the crossed wires, the signal jam. 
The static that grew between usits dull, murmuring protest.  And I would question
if there were others just like me, who had found themselves caught in your orbit.
Whether I was just another celestial body, sent up from the ground; 
when the moonthe original satellite is the only one you see from where youre standing.


A Stranger
There is a love I reminisce, 
like a seed 
Ive never sown.
Of lips that I am yet to kiss,
and eyes 
not met my own. 
Hands that wrap around my wrists,
and arms
that feel like home. 
I wonder how it is I miss,
these things
Ive never known.


The Saddest Thing 
There was someone I knew, a long time ago. I was so in love with him I couldnt
see straight. The saddest thing is, he felt the same way about me. 
It was easy in the beginning. All we had to do was laugh at the same things and
love took over and did the rest. I had never felt so connected to another person.  
He would always say it felt as though I was made for him. How glad he was to
have met me. We were so sure of what we felt. We should have held tight, onto that certainty. 
There is never one particular reason why two people are torn apart. 
All these years later, I have stopped looking for answers. 
I know better now, that love is never a guarantee. 
Not when you have the rest of the world to contend with. 
Sometimes you have to step back and look at these things from a philosophical standpoint. 
And I know loving him has taught me something about myself, 
it has broadened my understanding of the world. 
And if it has done the same for him, then it wasnt all in vain.


All or Nothing
If you love me
for what you see,
only your eyes would be
in love with me. 
If you love me
for what youve heard,
then you would love me
for my words. 
If you love
my heart and mind,
then you would love me,
for all that Im. 
But if you dont love
my every flaw,
then you mustnt love me
not at all.


Thoughts 
Dawn turns to day, 
as stars are dispersed;
wherever I lay,
I think of you first. 
The sun has arisen, 
the sky, a sad blue.
I quietly listen
the wind sings of you.
The thoughts we each keep,
that are closest to heart,
we think as we sleep
and youre always my last. 


Afraid to Love
I turn away 
and close my heart
to the promise of love
that is luring. 
For the past has taught
to not be caught,
in what is not 
worth pursuing
To never do
the things Ive done
that once had led
to my undoing.


Time
You were the one
I wanted most 
to stay. 
But time could not
be kept at bay.
The more it goes,
the more its gone
the more it takes away.


Broken Hearts
I know you've lost someone and it hurts. You may have lost them suddenly, unexpectedly.
Or perhaps you began losing pieces of them until one day, there was nothing left. 
You may have known them all your life or you may have barely known them at all.
Either way, it is irrelevant you cannot control the depth of a wound
another inflicts upon you. Which is why I am not here to tell 
you tomorrow will be a new day.
That the sun will go on shining. Or there are plenty of fish in the sea. 
What I will tell you is this; its okay to be hurting as much as you are. 
What you are feeling is not only completely valid but necessary because it 
makes you so much more human. And though I cant promise it will 
get better any time soon, I can tell you that it will eventually.
For now, all you can do is take your time. Take all the time you need. 



That Day
I remember our highs in hues,
like the color of his eyes
as the sun was setting;
the pale of his hands in mine,
and the blue of his smile. 
I remember our sorrows in shades,
like the gray of the shadows,
which loomed that day,
and the white in his lie
when he promised to stay.


The Keeper
You were like a dream,
I wish I hadnt 
slept through. 
Within it I fell deeper,
than your heart would 
care to let you. 
I thought you were a keeper,
I wish I could 
have kept you.


Metamorphosis
I am somebody elses story. The girl who served their drink, 
the person they pushed past on a crowded street, the one who broke their heart.
I have happened in so many places, to so many people the essence of me lives on
in these nuances, these moments. 
Yet never have I been bolder or brighter than I am with you. Not once have I ever
felt so alive. Whatever vessel we pour ourselves into, mine is now overflowing,
brimming with life. It is transcending into something new. 
Hands are no longer hands. They are caresses. Mouths are no longer mouths.
They are kisses. My name is no longer a name, it is a call. 
And love is no longer lovelove is you. 


Pretext 
Our lovea dead star
to the world it burns brightly
But it died long ago.

Lullabies


Waiting
I try to think of a word that is closest to love and the only thing that comes
to mind is your name. I try to imagine what I would say if our paths ever
crossed again but I keep drawing a blank. 
Ive forgotten what it was like to feel the sun on my skin without worrying that 
it could hurt me. Ive stopped throwing myself from cliffs,
with my arms in the air, waiting for the splash below. 
Every day, I look in the mirror and I see more and
more of my mothers face staring back at me. 
Every day I measure the weight of my past against the present and feel
the drag of what could have been. I find a photograph of you and wonder 
when Ill stop hoping. I stare at the clock, with
its slow methodical hands and dread the day when Ill know its too late.


Pieces of You
He knows I cant tell a joke without laughing. 
And how Im always talking about second chances.
He knows I sleep all day and wake up tired. 
And I could never give anyone a straight answer.
I cried the first time I told him about you. 
I said I was sorry as he held me so close. 
He said he now knew why my eyes were like searchlights.
How they looked at the sky with such longing. 
And why I read my stars in the paper each morning.
He left me one Sunday with his cup half empty. 
I padded downstairs and saw the writing on
the wall. Outside the rain was already falling. 
And there were still pieces of you behind every door.





The Seventh Sea
The answer is yes, always yes. I cannot deny you anything you ask. 
I will not let youbear the agony of not knowing. 
Yes I love you, I swear it. On every grain of salt in the oceanon all my tears.
I found you when I reached the seventh sea, just as I had stopped looking. 
It seems a lifetime ago that I began searching for you.
A lifetime of pain and sorrow. Of disappointment and missed opportunities. 
All I had hoped for. All the things I can never get back. 
When I am with you, I want for nothing. 




The Rose
Have you ever loved a rose,
and watched her slowly bloom;
and as her petals would unfold,
you grew drunk on her perfume.
Have you ever seen her dance,
her leaves all wet with dew;
and quivered with a new romance
the wind, he loved her too.
Have you ever longed for her,
on nights that go on and on;
for now, her face is all a blur,
like a memory kept too long. 
Have you ever loved a rose,
and bled against her thorns;
and swear each night to let her go,
then love her more by dawn.


My Heart
Perhaps I never loved enough, 
If only Id loved much more;
I would not nearly had so much,
left waiting, for you in store. 
If I had given away my heart
to those who came before;
it would be safer left in parts
but now you have it all.


Dj Vu
I saw it once, 
I have no doubt; 
but now cant place
its whereabouts. 
I try to think it, 
time and time;
but what it is,
wont come to mind.
A word, a scent
a feeling, past.
It will not show, 
though much Ive asked.
And when it comes,
I soon forget
this is how it felt,
when we first met. 


Her Words 
Love a girl who writes 
and live her many lives;
you have yet to find her,
beneath her words of guise.
Kiss her blue-inked fingers,
forgive the pens they marked.
The stain of your lips upon her
the one she cant discard.
Forget her tattered memories,
or the pages others took;
you are her ever after
the hero of her book.


Sad Songs 
Once there was a boy who couldnt speak but owned a music box that 
held every song in all the world. 
One day he met a girl who had never heard a single melody in he
entire life and so he played her his favorite song. 
He watched while her face lit up with wonder as the music filled
the sky and the poetry of lyrics moved her in a way she had never
felt before.  He would play his songs for her day after day and
she would sit by him quietly never seeming to mind that he could
only speak to her through song. She loved everything he played for her, 
but of them all she loved the sad songs best. 
So he began to play them more and more until eventually,
sad songs were all she would hear.
One day, he noticed it had been a very long time since her last smile. 
When he askedher why, she took both his hands in hers and 
kissed them warmly. She thanked him for his gift of music and poetry but above 
all else for showing her sadness because she had known neither
of these things before him. 
But it was now time for her to go away to find someone 
who could show her what happiness was. 

Do you remember the song that was playing the night we met?
No, but I remember every song I have heard since you left.


A Love Story 
Beyond the shores of melancholy, 
there was a time I held your hand. 
My heart now bears an untold story,
like a ship at sea, that longs for land.
A great untruth, my lips have borrowed,
a boundless treasure to line my chest; 
the wealth of words are in their sorrow
and words are all I can bequest. 
We will remain unwritten through history, 
no X will mark us on the map; 
but in books of prose and poetry, 
you loved me once, in a paragraph. 
And your love has left me, on this island, 
it has filled my cup up to the brink;
yet I grow thirsty in this silence 
there is not a drop for me to drink.


A Dream
As the Earth began spinning faster and faster, we floated upwards, 
hands locked tightly together, eyes sad and bewildered. 
We watched as our faces grew younger and 
realized the Earth was spinning in reverse,
moving us backwards in time. 
Then we reached a point where I no longer knew who you were and
I was grasping the hands of a stranger. But I didnt let go. 
And neither did you. I had my first dream about you last night.
Really? She smiles. What was it about?
I dont remember exactly, but the whole time I was dreaming, 
I knew you were mine.


Sunday Best
Do you remember that night I turned up on your doorstep? 
I was wearing my Sunday best. 
You watched the mascara as it ran down like fault lines, 
and you knew I had blood on my lips. 
Im tired of running, I said
and the earth shook a little.   
So am I, you replied
as it shook a little more.
I dont want anyone else, I whispered.
And I felt myself crumble.
You held out your arms and I was cracked porcelain. 
We looked at each other as we stood
at the precipice. 
And I knew once I fell, Id never stop falling. 
And everything before you would be time to kill. 
You said you were scared but you couldnt ignore it. 
And that was the moment when we became real.


Wishful Thinking
You say that you are over me,
my heart
it skips,
it sinks. 
I see you now with someone new,
I stare,
I stare,
I blink.
Someday Ill be over you,
I know,
I know
I think.


Wounded
A bruise is tender
but does not last, 
it leaves me as 
I always was. 
But a wound I take
much more to heart, 
for a scar will always
leave its mark. 
And if you should ask
which one you are,
my answer is
you are a scar.


A Way Out 
Do you know what it is like,
to lie in bed awake;
with thoughts to haunt
you every night,
of all your past mistakes. 
Knowing sleep will set it right
if you were not to wake. 


Ode to Sorrow
Her eyes, a closed book,
her heart, a locked door;
she writes melancholy
like shes lived it before.
She once loved in a way,
you could not understand;
he left her in pieces
and a pen in her hand.
The ode to her sorrow
in the life she has led
her scratches on paper,
the words they have bled.


Rogue Planets
As a kid, I would count backwards from ten and imagine at one, 
there would be an explosion perhaps
caused by a rogue planet crashing into Earth or some other major catastrophe.
When nothing happened, Id feel relieved and at the same time,
a little disappointed.
I think of you at ten; the first time I saw you. 
Your smile at nine and how it lit up something inside me 
I had thought long dead. Your lips at eight pressed against mine and at seven,
your warm breath in my ear and your hands everywhere. 
You tell me you love me at six and at five we have our first real fight.
At four we have our second and three, our third.
At two you tell me you cant go on any longer and then at one, 
you ask me to stay.
And I am relieved, so relieved and a little disappointed.


The Things We Hide
And so, 
I have put away 
the photographs, 
every trace of you 
I know. 
The things that seem 
to matter less,
are the ones 
we put on show.


Hope
One day you walk into a cafe and there he is. Its as simple as that. 
As easy as that. Then forever after, you spend your life, 
walking into cafes, hoping hell magically appear. 
Like he did the first time. 
Or there would be someone else, just like him, sitting, with his 
head buried in a book.  He would turn to look at you and it 
would all begin again. When love finds you, 
it doesnt come with crashing waves or thunderbolts. 
It appears as a song on the radio or a particular blue in the sky. 
It dawns on you slowly,  like a warm winter sunrise 
where the promise of summer shines out from within. 
We number our days and divide our seasons. 
We endlessly define what it is to be in love.
When in truth, spring blurs into summer and always has, 
long before that line was ever drawn. 
Your love for him is the same it runs wild and free. 
Like the air around you, it stretches all across the world, 
it does not leave a single thing untouched.
You carry that love with you, like a bright  and 
blazing beacon, a straight line from
your heart to his. And it keeps alive that aching, 
throbbing hope, that somewhere in
the world, there is a cafe and within those walls, 
he is there, hoping just as much as you.


Three Questions 
What was it like to love him? asked Gratitude. 
It was like being exhumed, I answered. And brought to life in a flash of brilliance. 
What was it like to be loved in return? asked Joy. 
It was like being seen after a perpetual darkness, I replied. 
To be heard after a lifetime of silence. 
What was it like to lose him? asked Sorrow. 
There was a long pause before I responded:
It was like hearing every good-bye ever said to mesaid all at once.


Always
You were you,
and I was I;
we were two
before our time. 
I was yours 
before I knew,
and you have always
been mine too.


New Light 
When goodbye was said,
there it began 
the careful tread
the ones you chose 
to love instead.
Yet inside you glows
a candle lit 
those years ago 
and brighter still
it burns for him
a searing flame
to stave the dark 
you hold within. 
The honor the promise 
you once made
when you and he
were skin to skin,
and the brightest star
had ceased its reign
to herald new light,
born in his name.


Letting Him Go
There is a particular kind of suffering to be experienced when you 
love something greater than yourself.
A tender sacrifice.
Like the pained silence felt in the lost song of a mermaid; 
or the bent and broken feet
of a dancing ballerina. It is in every considered step 
I am taking in the opposite direction of you.


Second Chances 
The path from you extending,
I could not see its course
or the closer to you I was getting,
the further from you Id walked. 
For I was moving in a circle,
not a line as I had thought
the steps I took away from you,
were taking me towards.


A Dedication 
She lends her pen,
to thoughts of him,
that flow from it,
in her solitary. 
For she is his poet,
And he is her poetry.


Forget Me Not 
The choice was once 
your choosing, 
before losing 
became my loss.
I was there in 
your forgetting
until I was forgot. 


Some Time Out
The time may not 
be prime for us, 
though you are
a special person. 
We may be just 
two different clocks,
that do not tock,
in unison.


Always with Me
Your love I once surrendered,
has never left my mind. 
My heart is just as tender,
as the day I called you mine. 
I did not take you with me,
but you were never left behind.


Soul Mates
I dont know how you are so familiar to meor why it feels less like I am getting
to know you and more as though I am remembering who you are. 
How every smile, every whisper brings me closer to the impossible conclusion
that I have known you before, I have loved you beforein another time, 
a different placesome other existence.


Reasons
I wish I knew why he left. What his reasons were. Why he changed his mind. 
For all these years, 
I have turned it over in my headall the possibilities yet none of them make any sense. 
And then I think, perhaps it was because he never loved me. 
But that makes the least sense of all.


An Artist in Love
I drew him in my world;
I write him in my lines,
I want to be his girl,
he was never meant as mine.
I drew him in my world;
he is always on my mind;
I draw his every line.
It hurts when hes unkind. 
I drew him in my world;
I draw him all the time,
but I dont know where 
to draw the line.


Happiness
I know my being happy is an anomaly. No one knows me better than you. 
But I can say without avoiding your gaze, without crossing my 
fingers behind my back; 
or the other things I do when speaking untruthfully I am happy. 
I know the rain does not discriminate between day or night and 
either will hold its own light 
and darkbut now, at this very moment, 
I feel like I am the sun. And I know in my heart, 
I will always look upon this timenot without a sense 
of melancholy that it was the happiest in my life.


The End 
I dont know what to say, he said. 
Its okay, she replied, I know what we are
and I know what were not.


A Poem
I wrote a poem about a girl who loves you. I said a soliloquy that was spoken in
her honor. 
I felt every word that burst from her lips, like shooting stars, 
into the air around us. If
it were possible to hold love in your hand, it was her hand 
that trembled as I held it. 
I could taste her tears that ran like rain on windshields. 
The kind that searched with longing, 
forlonely drop after drop, to form a pool of forlorn belonging.
I wrote this poem for the girl who loves youfor she 
loves you more than I love you.
Because she is sorry and so am I.


Entwined 
There is a line
Im yet to sever
it goes from me 
to you.
There was a time
you swore forever,
and I am captive
to its pull.
If you were kind,
youd cut the tether
but I must ask you
to be cruel.


Amends
I wonder if there will be a morning when youll wake up missing me. 
That some incident in your life would have finally 
taught you the value of my worth. 
And you will feel a surge of longing, 
when you remember how I was good to you. 
When this day comes I hope you will look for me. 
I hope you will look with the
kind of conviction Id always hoped for, but never had from you. 
Because I want to be found. And I hope it will be youwho finds me.


In Two Parts
You come and go so easily,
your life is as you knew
while mine is split in two. 
How I envy so the half of me,
who lived before loves due,
who was yet to know of you.


Have you ever felt it? That split second before the feeling catches the 
memory that small haven of neutrality, before the headlong crash into recognition.
Your mind pulls him to the foreground like a snapped rubber band. 
And you think of the line he drew in the sand, 
the one you cant seem to put a foot past. 
Like a tripwire, youre afraid of the damage but you know you cant keep standing still. 
And the world falls away and youre exactly where you were on the 
last night you saw him, when he had his hands in your hair and his mouth on
 your neck and he never said a word about leaving.


Stowaway 
I love the way he looks at me. Shy and half-cocked as though he is caught off guard,
like he is retracing his steps to remember all the ways to make me smile. 
He brings me flowers every Sunday and tells me stories about mermaids and sirens 
with their sharp claws and beguiling lips. He says I remind him of the sea 
and attaches me to a metaphor Ive never heard before, 
when I thought I must have heard them all. 
I think someone broke his heart once and now he cant bear to be apart from the ocean. 
He said its strange how the smallest things can wreck a ship. 
Like a rock, or a wave, or a hairline crack in the hull. 
He calls me his little stowaway and he says it sadly, 
tenderly, as though I can sink him.


Us 
I love him and he loves me.
We spend every moment together. When sleep parts us, we often meet in our dreams. 
I like to take naps throughout the day. Like a cat, he says. He is a cat person.

He thinks my eyes are beautiful and strange. 
He has never seen eyes like mine up close before.

He says they look at him with daggers when 
he has done something wrong. Like when he forgets
to order olives on my half of the pizza. 
He thinks I am especially cute when angry.
We argue over whose turn it is to put the DVD in the player. 
Sometimes no one wins and we end up watching bad TV. 
Which is never really a bad thing.
He never imagined he would be with someone like me. 
Now, he says, he cant imagine himself with anyone else. 

Were kids, arent we?
Yes, kids with grown-up powers.





For You 
Here are the things I want for you.
I want you to be happy. I want someone else to know the warmth of your smile, to
feel the way I did when I was in your presence. 
I want you to know how happy you once made me and though you really did hurt me,
in the end, I was better for it. I dont know if what we had was love, 
but if it wasnt, I hope never to fall in love. 
Because of you, I know I am too fragile to bear it. 
I want you to remember my lips beneath your fingers and how you told me 
things you never told another soul. I want you to know that I 
have kept sacred, everything you had entrusted in me and I always will. 
Finally, I want you to know how sorry I am for pushing you away when I had only
meant to bring you closer. And if I ever felt like home to you, 
it was because you were safe with me. I want you to know that most of all.


Dead Butterflies
I sometimes think about the fragility of glass of broken shards 
tearing against soft skin. When in truth, it is the transparency 
that kills you.  The pain of seeing through to something 
you can never quite touch. 
For years Ive kept you in secret, behind a glass screen. 
Ive watched helplessly as day after day,
your new girlfriend becomes your wife and then later, 
the mother of your children. 
Then realizing the irony in thinking you were the one under glass when
in fact it has been mea pinned butterflystatic and unmoving, 
watching while your other life unfolds.


Birthdays 
It is a ceremony, the blowing of candles, the cutting of a cake the mess 
of cream and sponge in your mouth. The taste is sweet and familiar, 
like a newly formed wish, fashioned from all the ones youve made before.
You dont remember them in sequencethe things you ask for. 
You only recall those you wanted the most.
Like the pair of neon pink roller skates you saw in the shop window 
when you were twelve. 
How deeply you felt their absence when you sat among the 
litter of torn wrapping paper and empty new possessions. 
Or the year you turned sixteen; 
when your best friends mother got really sick, 
and all you wanted
was for her to be okay again. It was the year you learned that shooting
stars were either a blessing or a curse, depending on what you 
wanted to believe.  Then there was that year you fell in love. 
The one where there werent any candlesjust you walking
late at night through the city streets with your heart in pieces, 
wanting to give yourself to the first stranger who called you beautiful. 
Since then its been the same every year. 
As soon as the first match is struck, the smell
of burning takes you backward through your memory. It stops you right 
at that moment on that warm, September night, as you watched the first 
trickle of melting wax hit the icing, and you couldnt think of a single 
damn thing you wanted because he was standing there, in the flickering light, 
asking you to make a wish.


Losing You 
I used to think I couldnt go a day without your smile. 
Without telling you things and hearing your voice back. 
Then, that day arrived and it was so damn hard but the next was harder. 
I knew with a sinking feeling it was going to get worse, and 
I wasnt going to be okay for a very long time. 
Because losing someone isnt an occasion or an event. 
It doesnt just happen once. It happens over and over again. 
I lose you every time I pick up your favorite coffee mug; 
whenever that one song plays on the radio, 
or when I discover your old t-shirt at the bottom of my laundry pile. 
I lose you every time I think of kissing you, holding you, or wanting you. 
I go to bed at night and lose you, when I wish 
I could tell you about my day. 
And in the morning, when I wake and reach for the empty space 
across the sheets,  I begin to lose you all over again.


A Toast!
To new beginnings,
in fear and faith
and all it tinges.
To love is a dare,
when hope and despair,
are gates upon it hinges.


The Poet 
Why do you write?  he asked. 
So I can take my love for you and give it to the world, I reply. 
Because you wont take it from me. 


The Professor
A streak of light flashes across the sky. 
Thick heavy raindrops pound the uneven dirt floor, littered with
dried leaves and twigs. She follows closely behind him, 
clutching an odd contraptiona rectangular device attached with a long, 
squiggly, antenna. You were right about the storm, 
Professor! she yells over the howling wind. Yes, my assistant! 
he cries, voice charged with excitement, as he holds up the long, 
metal conductor. She stumbles over a log as he reaches out to catch her.
They tumble on the dry grass laughing. He tosses aside the bent, 
silver coat hanger, wrapping his arms around her waist. 
The little transistor radio falls from her hands.
The sun peeks through the treetops. She thinks of their first conversation. 
I live by a forest, he said, describing it in such a
way that when she came to scale those crooked, winding stairs, 
it was like she had seen it a thousand times before. 
As if it had always been there, waiting to welcome her. 
Like the pretty, sunlit room that remained unfurnished, 
sitting empty in his house, now filled with her paints and brushes.
She would fondly call him her Frankenstein, this man who was a patchwork 
of all the things she had ever longed for. He gave her such gifts 
not the kind that were put in boxes, but the sort that filled her with 
imagination, breathing indescribable happiness into her life. 
One day, he built her a greenhouse. So you can create your little monstrous plants, 
he explained. He showed her how to catch the stray butterflies that fluttered 
from their elusive neighbors, who were rumored
to farm them for cosmetic use. 
She would listen in morbid fascination as 
he described how the helpless insects were cruelly dismembered, 
before their fragile wings were crushed and ground into a fine powder. 
Your lips would look beautiful, painted with butterfly wings,he would tease her.
Never! shed cry, alarmed. 
They spent much of their days alone, 
in their peaceful sanctuary, apart from the little visitor who came
on weekends. When the weather was good, 
the three of them would venture out, past the worn jetty and picnic 
on their little beach.  He would watch them proudly, 
marveling at the startling contrast 
between the two things he loved most in the world. 
His son with hair of spun gold, playing at his favorite rock pool and 
chattering animatedly in his singsong voice. She, with a small, amused smile on 
her tiny lips, raven hair tousled by the sea wind. 
She was different from anything he had ever known. 


The Stranger
Does it make you crazy? To think he saw youhis eyes passed over you and 
if only there had been some small mishap in that pivotal moment. 
A spilled drink, a stumble through the doorhis hand reaching out to steady you and 
it would have happened. A whole new world would have opened up 
like a vortex to swallow you both into blissful delirium.
 But you turned away, out of shyness or indecision and by the time you 
turned back, he was gone. How do you explain it without sounding unsound? 
That click you felt when your eyes met his, like the switch of a train track, 
transporting you for one miraculous moment, to what might have been. Then reality 
intervenes and with a shake of your head, you tell yourself to stop chasing shadows. But
I can tell you nowwhat you felt was realand you must always listen to that click. 
For it is the sound of your fate beckoning. It is the voice of your destiny calling. 
Sometimes it only calls once. 


Love
I dont know what it is like to love someone who the world tells me I am not
supposed to love. I cant imagine how hard it must be to love someone 
I am afraid to kiss on the street. 
But I do know what it is like to love someone who I cannot be with. 
I know
how it feels to have my brain tell me one thing, and my heart another. 
I know how hard it is to have to love someone in secret. 
To live with the knowledge that if circumstances had been different, 
I would be with the one I love. 
I do know there are all kinds of barriers to love. 
I do believe the world needs less
of them.


He and I
When words run dry,
he does not try,
nor do I. 
We are on par. 
He just is,
I just am,
and we just are.


Fading Polaroid
My eyes were the first to forget. The face I once cradled between my hands, now a blur.
And your voice is slowly drifting from my memory, like a fading polaroid. 
But the way I felt is still crystal clear. Like it was yesterday. 
There are Philosophers who claim the past, present, and future all exist at the one time. 
And the way I have felt, the way I feelthat bittersweet ache between 
wanting and having is evidence of their theory. 
I felt you before I knew you and I still feel you now. And in that brief moment
between wrapped in your arms thinking, how lucky I am, how lucky I am, how lucky I am
How lucky I was.


Soundtracks 
He once told me about his love for lyrics. How the words spoke to him like poetry. 
I would often wonder about his playlist and the ghosts who lived there. The faces he saw and
the voices he heard. The soundtrack to a thousand tragic endings, real or imagined. 
The first time I saw him, I noticed how haunted his eyes were. And I was drawn to
him, in the way a melody draws a crowd to the dance floor. Pulled by invisible strings. 
Now I wonder if I am one of those ghostsif I am somewhere, drifting between those notes. I
hope I am. I hope whenever my song plays, I am there, whispering in his ear.


More than Love 
Love was cruel, 
as I stood proud; 
he showed me you 
and I was bowed. 
He deftly dealt
his swiftest blow
I fell further than,
I was meant to go.
And he ashamed,
of what hed caused,
knew from then,
that I was yours. 
That he, an echo 
and you, the sound
I loved you more
than love allowed.


Forget her tattered memories, or the pages others took;
you are her ever after the hero of her book.


For Michael 
Reading you has made mea better writer.
Loving you has made mea better person.


Tsunamis 
Be careful about giving your heart too quickly, I was told. 
Boys only have one thing on their minds, they cautioned. 
I dont know if he truly loves mehow can I be sure? I cant say with any conviction
that he wont break my heartbut how could I have stopped him from taking what was already his? 
He swept in like a tsunami, wave after wave, and I didnt stand a chance. All those warnings,
all the things they tried to prepare me forlost in an instantto the enormity of what I felt.


Poetry
I know you have seen things you wish you hadnt. You have done things you wish you could
take back. And you wonder why you were thrown into the thick of it allwhy you had to suffer 
the way you did. And as you are sitting there alone and hurting, 
I wish I could put a pen in your hand and gently remind you how t
he world has given you poetry and now you must give it back.


The Wanderer
What is she like?
I was told
she is a 
melancholy soul.
She is like 
the sun to night;
a momentary gold.
A star when dimmed
by dawning light;
the flicker of
a candle blown.
A lonely kite 
lost in flight
someone once
had flown.


Signposts
What if certain people were signposts in your life? Representations of good or bad. 
Like an old friendyou see across a crowded street, one you wave hello to, before hurrying on. 
The last time you saw them, things took a turn for the worse and, as sad as it may seem,
they have unwittingly become an omena precursor of bad luck. 
Or that one person whom you rarely speak with, who can always be found right where you left
them. You carry their smile with you like a talismanfor whatever reason, their 
presence in your life will always bring the promise of better days. 
Then there is the boy you can never stop thinking about. 
Whenever you see his name, it trips
you up. Even if its one that belongs to many others, even if he belongs to someone else. 
You know he is a symbol of your weakness, your Kryptonite. 
How he rushes in like wildfire and burns through everything you 
worked so hard to build since he last left you in ashes. 
So you do the only thing you know howyou put as many miles as you can between him.
As many roadblocks and traffic lights as you can gather. 
Then you build a bold red stop sign right on your doorstep, 
knowing all the stop signs in the world could never hold him 
they can only ask him to stay awhile.


Sea of Strangers
In a sea of strangers,
youve longed to know me. 
Your life spent sailing
to my shores.
The arms that yearn
to someday hold me, 
will ache beneath 
the heavy oars.
Please take your time 
and take it slowly; 
as all you do
will run its course.
And nothing else
can take what only
was always meant
as solely yours.


Faith
I whisper your name like a prayerwith all the hope of heaven. 
I trace the lines of your palm and draw a map to salvation.  
I hear the knock of your heart and I answer it like my calling.


After the Storm 
There are storms that change the skyline, that leave patches of 
blue where branches had once spread their
brittle fingers. And in the aftermath, an eerie calm settles over the forest, 
as shell-shocked birds sing warily in the sunlight. 
The nervous flutter of their injured wings, 
barely audible above the hammering of a hummingbirds heart.
You once told me the wind is silent. 
How his sound can only be heard through collision. Last
night, he cried with a violent yearning while he tore through the trees. 
As he brought down their twisted branches, 
I thought of the first time you said my name. 
You were the storm that changed the skyline. 
After the damage and the deluge, I could see things
so much clearer. There hasnt been another like you since. 
In 1953, we began naming hurricanes so we could remember 
them beyond the wreckage. So we could try
to make sense of the destruction. This is the way I remember you.


The Most 
You may not know
the reason why, 
for a time
I wasnt I.
There was a man
who came and went, 
on him every breath
was spent.
Im sorry I forgot
all else
it was the most 
I ever felt.


Now and Then 
I was always meant for you. With my tennis shoes and wild hair, 
dragging a case with a
cello hidden between its velvet walls. Even then. 
I was always meant for you. In my black woolen dress and sapphire studs. 
Between hotel rooms and
standing ovations. Even now.  
I was never meant for road signs with foreign names, or 
lovers who spoke in exotic tongues. For
maps that were composed in a language I could not read and printed 
in a dialect I could not write. 
You said I was like a bird of prey, caged by my captors and made to sing love
songs to the sky. You said my sadness was like the sun, 
beautiful from a distance but it hurt you too much to come closer.  
I was never meant for poetry. For words carved into history, 
like ancient runes that told the same
tragic tale over and over. 
If any historian were to decipher the symbols hammered into stone, 
they would say I was meant for you. 
Even before the first mallet had struck iron, 
even after all civilization has crumbled into dust and 
the sky is set alight with a thousand exploding starseven then. 


The Night
Its been a while since words have found me,
the time betweenyoull come and go; 
Id grown to love the sun around me, 
Ive been a stranger to my woe. 
Its been so long since there was silence,  
all around me, your voice had rung;
like a bird who sings to greet the morning,
to tell you that the day has come.
Its been some time since Ive felt lonely,
like a book that is no longer read;
the darkness lingers on without you,
it fills my empty heart with dread. 
It seems an age ago, since you have left me,
time has filled me, with words unsaid;
as the sadness seeps into me slowly,
and I am left to face the night ahead.


The Girl He Loves
There was a man who I once knew,
for me there was no other.
The closer to loving me he grew,
the more he would grow further. 
I tried to love him as his friend,
then to love him as his lover;
but he never loved me in the end
his heart was for another.


Lullabies 
I barely know you, she says, voice heavy with sleep. 
I dont know your favorite color or how
you like your coffee. What keeps you up at night or the 
lullabies that sing you to sleep. 
I dont know a thing about the first girl you loved, 
why you stopped loving her or why you still do. 
I dont know how many millions of cells you are made of and if they have any idea
they are part of something so beautiful and unimaginably perfect. 
I may not have a clue about any of these things, but thisshe places her hand on his
chestthis I know.


Dyslexia 
There were letters I wrote you that I gave up sending, long before I stopped writing. 
I dont remember their contents, but I can recall with 
absolute clarity, your name scrawled across the pages. 
I could never quite contain you to those messy sheets of blue ink. 
I could not stop you from overtaking everything else. 
I wrote your name over and overon scraps of paper, in books and on the back of my
wrists. I carved it like sacred markings into trees and the tops of my thighs. 
Years went by and the scars have vanished, but the sting has not left me. 
Sometimes when I read a book, parts will lift from the pages in an anagram of your name.
 Like a code to remind me its not over. Like dyslexia in reverse.



Stardust
If you came to me with a face I have not seen, with a voice I have never
heard, I would still know you. Even if centuries separated us, I would still feel you. 
Somewhere between the sand and the stardust, through every collapse and creation, 
there is a pulse that echoes of you and I. 
When we leave this world, we give up all our possessions and our memories. Love is the only
thing we take with us. It is all we carry from one life to the next.


Wallflower
Shrinking in a corner,
pressed into the wall;
do they know Im present,
am I here at all?

Is there a written rule book,
that tells you how to be
all the right things to talk about
that everyone has but me?

Slowly I am withering
a flower deprived of sun;
longing to belong to
somewhere or someone.


Lost Things
Do you know when youve lost somethinglike your favorite t-shirt or a set of keysand while looking for
it, you come across something else you once missed but have long since forgotten? 
Well whatever it was, there was a point where you decided to stop searching, 
maybe because it was no longer required or a new replacement was found. 
It is almost as if it never existed in the first placeuntil that moment of rediscovery, 
a flash of recognition. 
Everyone has one an inventory of lost things waiting to be found. 
Yearning to be acknowledged for the worth
they once held in your life. 
I think this is where I belongamong all your other lost things. 
A crumpled note at the bottom
of a drawer or an old photograph pressed between the pages of a book. 
I hope someday you will find me and remember what I once meant to you.


A Question
It was a question I had worn on my lips for dayslike a loose thread on my favorite
sweater I couldnt resist pullingdespite knowing it could all unravel around me. 
Do you love me? I ask. 
In your hesitation I found my answer. 


Love Lost
There is one who you belong to, 
whose lovethere is no song for.
And though you know its wrongful,
there is someone else you long for.
Your heart was once a vessel,
it was filled up to the brim;
until the day he left you, 
now everything sings of him.
Of the two who came to love you, 
to one, your heart you gave.
He lives in stars above you
in the love who came and stayed.


Home
Do you think of me on airplanes? With your headphones snug around your ears 
and the clouds below?
Do you think of my hands as you are exploring new territorythe freedom, 
the thrill, the rush? When you travel against the turn of our planet, 
does it take you back into the past?
I think of you on jet planes. In thoughts that go a million miles an hour. 
Over toytowns and towers made of tin. Nothing feels real without you.
Do you think of what could have been? In the early morning light when 
you wake up next
to some stranger, wondering why you dont feel a thing. 
In every bar room and bedroom where youre forced into conversation or 
giving away parts of yourselfdo you miss me? 
Do you think of me in cars? When every turn you take is driving us further apart. Does
every road sign pleading you to take care, 
remind you of how much I want you, how deeply you are loved?
I think of you on roads that stretch into the horizon. 
On roundabouts and signs that keep telling
me I am going in the wrong direction. 
I hope you think of me as much as I think of you. 
I hope that every step will bring you closer, that every dead end is a messenger, 
willing you to turn back around, reminding you its time to come home.


Language
I remember learning the alphabet. How those strange markings, alien and incoherent, 
grew more and more familiar, like
the name of someone you love. 
The moment words found me, they burrowed themselves into my bones, 
they settled like dust in my lungs
until I felt them every time I breathed in and out. I would place them side 
by side like fractals, in a myriad of verse. 
I remember learning your name, the strange jumble of letters that danced under 
my tongue, that leapt from
my hungry mouth. Those four syllables that bit deep into my soul like poetry. 
I remember how I whispered them against your lips. 
And you would say, this is how I am with you, with you.  
It was words that I fell for. In the end, it was words that broke my heart.


Patience 
Patience and Love agreed to meet at a set time and place; 
beneath the twenty-third tree in the olive orchard. 
Patience arrived promptly and waited. She checked her watch every so often 
but still, there was no sign of Love. 
Was it the twenty-third tree or the fifty-sixth? 
She wondered and decided to check, just in case. 
As she made her way over to the fifty-sixth tree, 
Love arrived at twenty-three, where Patience was noticeably absent. 
Love waited and waited before deciding he must have the wrong 
tree and perhaps it was another where
they were supposed to meet.  Meanwhile, Patience had 
arrived at the fifty-sixth tree, 
where Love was still nowhere to be seen. 
Both begin to drift aimlessly around the olive orchard, 
almost meeting but never do. 
Finally, Patience, who was feeling lost and resigned, 
found herself beneath the same tree where she began. She
stood there for barely a minute when there was a tap on her shoulder. 
It was Love. 

Where are you? she asked. I have been searching all my life.
Stop looking for me, Love replied, and I will find you.


Numbers
Nothing felt like mine anymore, not after you. 
All those little things that defined me; 
small sentimental trinkets,
car keys, pin codes, and passwords. They all felt like you. 
And more than anything else, my numberthe one you boldly asked for that night, 
amidst a sea of people, under a sky of talking satellites and glowing stars. 
You said no matter how many times you erased me from your phone, 
you would still recognize that
number when it flashed on your screen. The series of sixes and nines, 
like the dip of my waist to the curve of my hips, 
your hands pressed into the small of my back. 
Nines and sixes that were reminiscent of two contented cats, 
curled together like a pair of speech marks. 
You said if you could never hold me or kiss me again, 
you could live with that. But you couldnt bear 
the thought of us not  speaking and asked, at the very least, 
could I just allow you that one thing? I wonder what went through your mind the 
day you dialed my number to find it had been disconnected. 
If your imagination had raced with thoughts of what new city I had run to 
and who was sharing my bed. 
Isnt it strange how much of our lives are interchangeable, 
how little is truly ours. 
Someone elses ring tone, someone elses song, 
someone elses words, 
someone elses broken heart. 
These are the things we inherit by choice or by chance. 
And it wasnt my choice to love you but it was mine to leave. I dont think the
moon ever meant to be a satellite, kept in loving orbit, 
locked in hopeless inertia, 
destined to repeat the same pattern over and overto meet in 
eclipse with the sun only when the numbers allowed.


Part two
Remember When

In the End
I was ready to give it all upeverything. 
I was half out of my mind with love. 
AndI didnt think twice about what 
I was throwing into the fire, 
as long as I could keep it burning for just another 
minuteif only I was allowed to sit awhile longer beside its pale glow. 
That was how I loved you in the end. 
With my body cold and shuddering. With empty hands
over smoldering ash, counting out the minutes.


You
There are people I will never know
and their lives will still ensue;
those that could have loved me so
and Ill never wonder who. 
Of all the things to come and go,
there is no one else like you.
The things I never think about
and the only thing I do. 


A Writers Muse
One day he will find you. 
He will touch you and you will feel a lifetime of indifference
of apathy melt away in a single moment. And you will ache for him. 
You will love him, in the way you walk a tightrope
in the way people learn to fall asleep in a war zone. 
You will bleed for him until the day he is gone. 
You will bleed for him every day after that. 
The time will pass and you will feel robbedand you will grow bitter. 
You will ask why, but you wont get an answer. 
And that is when the words will come.


Nostalgia
Do you remember our first day? The fog lifted and all 
around us were trees linking hands, like
children playing.
Our first night, when you stood by the door, 
conflicted, as I sat there with my knees tucked
under my chin, and smiling.
Then rainbows arching over and the most 
beautiful sunsets I have ever seen.
How the wind howls as the sea whispers, I miss you.
Come back to me.


Closure
Like time suspended,
a wound unmended
you and I.
We had no ending, 
no said good-bye.
For all my life,
Ill wonder why.


Sad Things 
Why do you write sad things?  he asked. When I am here, when I love you. 
Because someday, in one way or another, you will be taken from me or I you. It is
inevitable. But please understand; from the moment I met you, 
I stopped writing for the past. I no longer write for the present. 
When I write sad things, I am writing for the future.


Swan Song
Her heart is played
like well-worn strings;
in her eyes,
the sadness sings
of one who was destined
for better things.



Forever 
for Now Stretching out from here to then, days before us, came and 
went. Someday we will
meet again, for now the end of days on end. 


Karma 
Sorrow tells stories, I relay them to wisdom;  I play them like records 
to those who will listen.I know to be thankful,  
I was given my time;  to those who have 
loved him your heartache is mine.To the one who will keep him, and the hearts 
he has kept  your love, when it leaves him his greatest regret.


Passing Time
I feel the end is drawing near,  would time be so kind to slow?  You
are everything to me, my dear, you are all I really know. But as I sit and wait 
and fear  and watch the hours goEverything that happened here  happened long 
ago.


A Letter
It was beautifully worded and painfully read; the things that were 
written, were those never said.His lies
were my comfort, but the truth I was owed I so wanted to know it, now I wish 
not to know.


Pretext
 Our lovea dead star to the world it burns brightly
But it died long ago. 


Amends
I wonder if there will be a morning when youll wake up missing me. That 
some incident in
your life would have finally taught you the value of my worth. And you will 
feel a surge of longing, when you remember how I was good to you. When this day 
comes I hope you will look for me. I hope you will look with the kind of 
conviction Id always hoped for, but never had from you. Because I want to be 
found. And I hope it will be youwho finds me. 


Stay
 The words I heard from you today,  are said when  theres nothing  left to
say. What I would give to make you stay, I would give it  all away.


Over My Head
I count his breaths, in hours unslept, against hours of him, I have 
left.With him lying
there, with him unaware, I am out of my depth. 


Thoughts of You There were times when I was with him and it was too much. Does 
that
make sense? When someone stirs a world of emotion in you and its so intense you 
can barely stand to be with him. During those moments, I wanted so desperately 
to leaveto go home, walk into my bedroom, and shut the door behind me. Crawl 
into bed and lay there in the dark, tracing the outline of my lips with my 
fingersreplaying everything he said, everything we did. I wanted to be left 
alonewith nothing other than my thoughts of him.


VaniaVania Zouravliov,thats
his name! My favorite artist. I wanted his book that 
time . . . very badly, in fact. I tipped my little coin purse 
upside down and counted all my money. I was 
short twenty dollars! She lies on her stomach by the fire with her sketchpad 
open, lazy pencil strokes lining the paper with each flick of her wrist.Oh, 
poor you, he says sympathetically. Do you know what, sweetheart, well get you 
that book.Thanks, baby. She smiles at him then returns to her sketching. Ill 
tell you how, he continues, snapping his laptop shut. She looks up, bemused. 
Pencil down, chin propped in hand. Im list-en-ing, she says in a singsong 
voice. Okay, so heres what you do. You go into the bookstore and you buy a cheap 
paperback novel. Smile sweetly and make small talk with the people at the 
register. Turn on the charm,justlike the way you do when youre trying to flog 
me your sketches. Hey look! I just drew these. What do you think? Dyou wanna 
buy them? She giggles.Then, he says, after youve finished paying, wander over to 
where the book is, pick it up and flip through it, looking as if you didnt have 
a care in the world.He lets out a small chuckle, leaning forward. Then
my dear,  you get as close as you can to the entrance without attracting any 
attention.And you bolt!As fast as you can, down the escape route that we would 
have planned the day before. Ill be in the car waiting so as soon as you jump 
in, Ill put my foot down, hard, on the accelerator, speed off to somewhere 
quiet before we stop and Ill look at you and say, Can you believe you did that? 
How does it feel? And youll be sitting there, your adrenaline pumping, your 
heart racing, hugging the book against your chest, saying, Oh my God! I cant 
believe I just did that! Then do you know what Id do?Whatwouldyoudo? she says 
between peals of laughter.Id take you out, fuck you up against the car.


Melancholy Skies 
Three summers passed of sun-drenched dreams, of snow white 
clouds and you and me. The
warmth of love, all summer long, through winters chill wed carry on.Each 
seasons end  began anew, until the last I shared with you.
They gave us years,  though many ago;  the spring cries tears the winter, snow. 


A Phone Call We said hello at half past one, all our chores for the morning 
done; and as we spoke about our day, the world began to fall away.
To our highest hopes and deepest fears,
if I had one wish, Id wish you here, the tantrums and the horror shows, the 
stories only
you would know. All the while with the ticking clock, laughing as if wed never 
stop; we said good night at half past ten at midnight we said good night again. 


Sad Things Why do you write sad things? he asked. When I am here, when I love 
you.
Because someday, in one way or another, you will be taken from me or I you. It 
is inevitable. But please understand; from the moment I met you, I stopped 
writing for the past. I no longer write for the present. When I write sad 
things, I am writing for the future.


The Seventh SeaThe answer is yes, always yes. I cannot deny you anything you 
ask. I will not
let you bear the agony of not knowing. Yes I love you, I swear it. On every 
grain of salt in the oceanon all my tears. I found you when I reached the 
seventh sea, just as I had stopped looking. It seems a lifetime ago that I 
began searching for you.A lifetime of pain and sorrow. Of disappointment and 
missed opportunities. All I had hoped for. All the things I can never get back. 
When I am with you, I want for nothing. 


The Poet Why do you write?  he asked. So I can take my love for you and
give it to the world, I reply. Because you wont take it from me. 


Musical ChairsWhen the music stood still, I was standing at an empty chair.I 
could feel you smiling behind
me. (We sense these things while dreaming.) Your hands were on my shoulders, 
your kisses against my neck. Then from somewhere, the music of a piano as she 
sings to Mozart, no one will ever know me the way you do. 




Interlude
She was different from anything he had ever known. 
THE PROFESSOR


Minefield
If you know a boy with eyes of quiet wonderment, who smiles often and 
speaks rarelysomeone who pays
the same respect to words as he would a minefieldwho thinks deeply and is 
endearingly sadplease do not give your heart to him. Even when he gently pleads 
with youor clutches your hand with grave earnestno matter how he tries to 
convince you, please turn him away. You dont know him like I know him. You cant 
love him like I do. 


Pen Portrait
She doesnt keep time,  so she stopped wearing watches. Her promise 
wont bind, so no one
holds her to them.She lives in the past, so her present never catchesHer 
thoughts do not last,  so her pen must tattoo them.


Acceptance 
There are things I miss that I shouldnt,  and those I dont that I 
should. Sometimes
we want what we couldnt sometimes we love who we could.


Concentric Circles
Aging is a euphemism for dying, and the age of a tree can 
only be counted by
its rings, once felled. Sometimes I feel there are so many rings inside meand 
if anyone were to look, they would see I have lived and died many times over, 
each time shedding my leaves bare with the hope of renewalthe desire to be 
reborn. Like concentric circles that spill outwards across the waterI wish I 
could wear my rings on the surface and feel less ashamed of them. Or better 
yet, to be completely stripped and baptizedmy lines vanishing like a newly 
pressed garment, a still pond. 


Duet In books unread,we lie between their pages. As they turn us to 
loverslike seasons changes.


His Kiss
He has me at his every whim; everything starts with him. To all the 
boys I used
to kiss everything stops with his.


Closure 
Like time suspended, a wound unmended you and I. We had no ending,  no 
said good-bye.For all my
life, Ill wonder why.


Lost Words
A midnight scribble, a morning sigh;  
you watch the words  curl up and die. Madness
lives inside your head, of poems lost  and pages dead. 
A mind possessed  by unmade books, unwritten lines on empty hooks. 



Sea of Strangers
In a sea of strangers, youve longed to know me. 
Your life spent sailing to
my shores. The arms that yearn to someday hold me, 
will ache beneath  the heavy  oars.
Please take your time and take it slowly;  
as all you do will run its course. 
And nothing else can take what only was always meant as solely yours.


Dyslexia 
There were letters I wrote you that I gave up sending, long before I 
stopped writing. I
dont remember their contents, but I can recall with absolute clarity, your name 
scrawled across the pages. I could never quite contain you to those messy 
sheets of blue ink. I could not stop you from overtaking everything else. I 
wrote your name over and overon scraps of paper, in books and on the back of my 
wrists. I carved it like sacred markings into trees and the tops of my thighs. 
Years went by and the scars have vanished, but the sting has not left me. 
Sometimes when I read a book, parts will lift from the pages in an anagram of 
your name. Like a code to remind me its not over. Like dyslexia in reverse. 


Time
You were the one I wanted most  to stay. But time could not be kept at 
bay.The more it goes, the more its gone the more it takes away.


That Night
It was one of those nights that you are not altogether sure really 
did happen. There are no photographs, no receipts, 
no scrawled journal entries. Just the memory 
sitting in my mind, like a half-blown dandelion, waiting to be fractured, 
dismembered. Waiting to disintegrate into nothing.As I close my eyes, the 
pictures play like a blurry montage. I can see us driving for hours, until the 
street signs grew less familiarthe flickering lamplights giving away to stars. 
Then sitting across from you in that quiet, little Italian place. Your hands 
pushing the plates aside, reaching across for mine. The conversations we had 
about everything and nothing. And kissing you. How I remember that. It was one 
of those nights that my mind still cant be sure of. That wonders if I was ever 
there at all. Yet in my heart, it is as though Ive never left. 


A Cautionary Tale
There is a girl who never returns her library books. Dont give 
her your heartit is
unlikely you will ever see it again.


 


Loves Paradox
There is a tide that rolls away, I want to make it stay.A borrowed 
book sits on my shelf, I want it for myself.There are two old hands that move this clock, I 
want to make them stop. There is a love you sold to me, I keep it under lock 
and yet you hold the key.


Devotion
He is more to me  than I. I love him more than I can bear.So much at
times I wish to die, so I can end this on a high.


Change of Heart 
You were faultless I was flawed,
I was lesser yet you  gave 
more.Now with time, I find you  on my mindPerhaps I loved you, after all.


Chapter 3
Finale
They gave us years, though many ago; the spring cries tearsthe 
winter, snow. 



Loving You
I saw him the other day. His arms around another girl, his eyes when  met with
minewere slow in their recognition. 
I wonder if he remembers what I once told  him. 
I will love you forever.He had smiled at me sadly before giving his reply.
But I am so afraid you may one day stop. Now all these years later, I am
the one who is afraid. Because I love him, I still do. I havent stopped. I dont 
think I can. I dont think I ever will. 


Broken Hearts
I know youve lost someone and it hurts. You may have lost them 
suddenly, unexpectedly. Or perhaps
you began losing pieces of them until one day, there was nothing left. You may 
have known them all your life or you may have barely known them at all. Either 
way, it is irrelevant you cannot control the depth of a wound another inflicts 
upon you. Which is why I am not here to tell you tomorrow will be a new day. 
That the sun will go on shining. Or there are plenty of fish in the sea. What I 
will tell you is this; its okay to be hurting as much as you are. What you are 
feeling is not only completely valid but necessarybecause it makes you so much 
more human. And though I cant promise it will get better any time soon, I can 
tell you that it willeventually. For now, all you can do is take your time. 
Take all the time you need. 


Loves Inception
I did not know  that it was love until I knew. There was never 
another to compare with you. But since you left, each boy I meet, will always 
have you to compete. 


False Hope
I dont know if I want you, he says. But I do know I dont want
anyone else to have you. It wasnt good enough, I knew that. Honestly I did. In 
my mind it was crystal clear. My heart however, was having a serious case of 
selective hearing. All it heard was, I dont want anyone else to have you. And 
within thatwas a glimmer of hope, a spark of optimism.


A Winter Song 
She was the song,  in a chorus unheard.  You were the summer in her
winter of verse. Yours was the melody she wanted to learn; it clung to her 
lips,  in silence it yearned.It seems as though now, 
you forgot every word; in 
a field full of flowers, she was the first.
There once was a song  you reminded 
her of she no longer longs, yet she still loves.


Ode to Sorrow
Her eyes, a closed book, her heart, a locked door; she writes 
melancholy like shes lived
it before.She once loved in a way, you could not understand; he left her in 
pieces and a pen in her hand.The ode to her sorrow in the life she has led her 
scratches on paper, the words they have bled. 


Hes Leaving
My nine  is your noon; Im just packing now your winter, my June. 
wish I could pack you. 





For Michael 
I love you, I do you have my word. You have all my words.


Fading Polaroid
My eyes were the first to forget. The face I once cradled 
between my hands, now a blur. 
And your voice is slowly drifting from my memory, like a fading polaroid. 
But the way I felt is still crystal clear. Like it was yesterday. There are 
philosophers who claim the past, present, and future all exist at the one time. 
And the way I have felt, the way I feelthat bittersweet ache between wanting 
and havingis evidence of their theory. I felt you before I knew you and I still 
feel you now. And in that brief moment between wrapped in your arms thinking, 
how lucky I am, how lucky I am, how lucky I am 
How lucky I was. 


Wishing Stars
I still search for you in crowds, in empty fields and soaring 
clouds. In city lights and passing cars, 
on winding roads and wishing stars. I wonder where you could 
be now,  for years Ive not said your name out loud.
And longer since I called 
you mine time has passed for you and I. 
Yet I have learned  to live without, I 
do not mind I still love you anyhow. 


Forewarned If a boy ever says, you remind me of someon edont fall in love with 
him. You will never be anything more than second best.


Lullabies
I barely know you, she says, voice heavy with sleep. I dont know your 
favorite color orhow you like your coffee. 
What keeps you up at night or the lullabies that sing 
you to sleep. I dont know a thing about the first girl you loved, why you 
stopped loving her or why you still do. I dont know how many millions of cells 
you are made of and if they have any idea they are part of something so 
beautiful and unimaginably perfect. I may not have a clue about any of these 
things, but thisshe places her hand on his chest this I know.


Deja Vu
saw it once,  I have no doubt;  but now cant place its whereabouts. I
try to think it,  time and time; but what it is, wont come to mind.A word, a 
scent a feeling, past. It will not show,  though much Ive asked.And when it 
comes, I soon forget this is how it felt, when we first met. 


Forget Me Not 
The choice was once  your choosing,  before losing  became my 
loss. I was there in  your forgetting until I was forgot. 


Clocks 
Here in time,  you are mine;  my heart has not  sung louder. I do not
know  why I love you so the clock knows not  its hour. Yet it is clear,  to all 
thats here, that time is told  by seeing. Even though  clocks do not know,  it 
is the reason  for their being.




Metamorphosis
I am somebody elses story. The girl who served their drink, the 
person they pushed past on a
crowded street, the one who broke their heart. I have happened in so many 
places, to so many peoplethe essence of me lives on in these nuances, these 
moments. Yet never have I been bolder or brighter than I am with you. Not once 
have I ever felt so alive. Whatever vessel we pour ourselves into, mine is now 
overflowing, brimming with life. It is transcending into something new. Hands 
are no longer hands. They are caresses. Mouths are no longer mouths. They are 
kisses. My name is no longer a name, it is a call. And love is no longer 
lovelove is you. 


Living a Lie
Thoughts that she cannot unthink; a life that she cannot 
unlive.Skipping stones to watch them sink;
she envies how  they easily.Sorrow wraps her like a scarf; waiting for a  small 
reprieve falling in and out  of love. 

Three Questions What was it like to love him? asked Gratitude. It was like 
being exhumed, I answered.
And brought to life in a flash of brilliance. What was it like to be loved in 
return? asked Joy. It was like being seen after a perpetual darkness, I 
replied. To be heard after a lifetime of silence. What was it like to lose him? 
asked Sorrow. There was a long pause before I responded:It was like hearing 
every good-bye ever said to mesaid all at once.


Signposts
What if certain people were signposts in your life? Representations of 
good or bad. Like an old friend
you see across a crowded street, one you wave hello to, before hurrying on. The 
last time you saw them, things took a turn for the worse and, as sad as it may 
seem, they have unwittingly become an omena precursor of bad luck. Or that one 
person whom you rarely speak with, who can always be found right where you left 
them. You carry their smile with you like a talismanfor whatever reason, their 
presence in your life will always bring the promise of better days. Then there 
is the boy you can never stop thinking about. Whenever you see his name, it 
trips you up. Even if its one that belongs to many others, even if he belongs 
to someone else. You know he is a symbol of your weakness, your Kryptonite. How 
he rushes in like wildfire and burns through everything you worked so hard to 
build since he last left you in ashes. So you do the only thing you know howyou 
put as many miles as you can between him. As many roadblocks and traffic lights 
as you can gather. Then you build a bold red stop sign right on your doorstep, 
knowing all the stop signs in the world could never hold himthey can only ask 
him to stay awhile.


Mementos
You were none, and now youre all; your worth will rise, the more I 
fall. Like these
mementos we have stored, once were things now so much more.


Rogue Planets
As a kid, I would count backwards from ten and imagine at one, 
there would be an
explosionperhaps caused by a rogue planet crashing into Earth or some other 
major catastrophe. When nothing happened, Id feel relieved and at the same 
time, a little disappointed.I think of you at ten; the first time I saw you. 
Your smile at nine and how it lit up something inside me I had thought long 
dead. Your lips at eight pressed against mine and at seven, your warm breath in 
my ear and your hands everywhere. You tell me you love me at six and at five we 
have our first real fight. At four we have our second and three, our third. At 
two you tell me you cant go on any longer and then at one, you ask me to 
stay.And I am relieved, so relievedand a little disappointed.


Afterthought
Thoughts I think of presently,  will come and go with ease while 
thoughts of you, from long
before, have yet to make their leave.The memory of you and I, still finds me 
here and now; tomorrow has arrived and gone yet your voice to me, resounds.
For if my present were an echo of,  a past I cant forgetThen these thoughts are 
just
an afterthought and I am always in its debt. 


For You
Here are the things I want for you.I want you to be happy. I want 
someone else to know the warmth of your smile, 
to feel the way I did when I was in your 
presence. I want you to know how happy you once made me and though you really 
did hurt me, in the end, I was better for it. I dont know if what we had was 
love, but if it wasnt, I hope never to fall in love. Because of you, I know I 
am too fragile to bear it. I want you to remember my lips beneath your fingers 
and how you told me things you never told another soul. I want you to know that 
I have kept sacred, everything you had entrusted in me and I always will. 
Finally, I want you to know how sorry I am for pushing you away when I had only 
meant to bring you closer. And if I ever felt like home to you, it was because 
you were safe with me. I want you to know that most of all. 


Message in a Bottle
No one truly knows who they are, he sighs. The glass bottle  does not know
its own contents. It has no idea whether it is a vessel for the most delicious 
apple cider, a lovingly crafted wine, or a bitter poison. People are the same. 
Yet like the bottle, we are transparent. We cant see ourselves the way others 
see us. How do you see me? she asked.You are a bottle floating out at sea, he 
says. One that contains a very important message. It may never reach its 
recipient, but as long as there is someone waiting, it will always have 
purpose.Will you wait for mine?I will, he promised. I will look for you every 
time I stand at the edge of the ocean.


Soundtracks
 He once told me about his love for lyrics. How the words spoke to 
him like poetry.
I would often wonder about his playlist and the ghosts who lived there. The 
faces he saw and the voices he heard. The soundtrack to a thousand tragic 
endings, real or imagined. The first time I saw him, I noticed how haunted his 
eyes were. And I was drawn to him, in the way a melody draws a crowd to the 
dance floor. Pulled by invisible strings. Now I wonder if I am one of those 
ghostsif I am somewhere, drifting between those notes. I hope I am. I hope 
whenever my song plays, I am there, whispering in his ear.


Two Fishermen
A girl came upon a fisherman at the waters edge and watched as he  cast his net
into the wide, open sea. On closer inspection, she noticed how all the knots 
that usually held a net together were unknotted. Why do you throw a knotless 
net into the water? she asked. I want to catch all fish in the ocean, he 
replied. But there are none I wish to keep.She walked on a little further and 
came across another fisherman, holding a simple line. She studied him quietly 
as he reeled his catch in, before returning it to the water. After he repeated 
this several times, the girl asked him, Why do you catch them just to throw 
them back? There is only one fish I want to catch and so, no other holds my 
interest.


Angels
It happens like this. One day you meet someone and for some inexplicable 
reason, you feel more connected
to this stranger than anyone elsecloser to them than your closest family. 
Perhaps because this person carries an angel within themone sent to you for 
some higher purpose, to teach you an important lesson or to keep you safe 
during a perilous time. What you must do is trust in themeven if they come hand 
in hand with pain or sufferingthe reason for their presence will become clear 
in due time.Though here is a word of warningyou may grow to love this person 
but remember they are not yours to keep. Their purpose isnt to save you but to 
show you how to save yourself. And once this is fulfilled, the halo lifts and 
the angel leaves their body as the person exits your life. They will be a 
stranger to you once more

Its so dark right 
now, I cant see any light around me.Thats because the light is coming from you. 
You cant see it but everyone else can.


Dumplings
Her impatient hands work slowly.Like this, she says.Then you dip your 
finger in the egg yolk.Put it between
the sheet and press it down firmly. She watches as he fumbles.The little pocket 
of pastry is foreign in his hands. She reaches out, placing hers on either side 
of his face. Pulling him towards her, she kisses him warmly. This is why I love 
you.The sides of his face are white from her flour-coated hands.It makes her 
laugh.If only you could see yourself the way I do.He smiles sheepishly.Yours 
are so pretty, he says. He puts down the oddly shaped dumpling.And picks up 
another sheet of pastry.


Beach Ball
Do you know that feeling? When its like youve lost something but cant 
remember what it was.
Its as though youre trying so desperately to think of a word but it wont come 
to you. Youve said it a thousand times before and it was always thereright 
where you left it. But now you cant recall it. You try and try to make it 
appear and it almost does, but it never does. There are times when I think it 
could surfacewhen I sense it at the tip of my tongue. When I feel it struggling 
to burst from my chest like a beach ball that can only be held beneath the 
water for so long. I can feel it stirring each time someone hurts me. When I 
smile at a stranger and they dont smile back. When I trust someone with a 
secret and they betray me. When someone I admire tells me I am not good enough. 
I dont know what it is or what I have lost. But I know it was important, I know 
it once made me happy. 


An Artist in Love
I drew him in my world; I write him in my lines, I want to
be his girl, he was never meant as mine.I drew him in my world; He is always on 
my mind; I draw his every line. It hurts when hes unkind. I drew him in my 
world; I draw him all the time, but I dont know where  to draw the line. 


The Dinner Guest
The wine, sipped too quickly, has gone to my head. I watch the 
way your hands
move as you tell your joke and laugh a little too loudly when you deliver the 
punch line. His eyes flash at me from across the table. The same disapproving 
look he shot me earlier, as I was getting dressed. Its a bit tight.Dont be 
ridiculous, I say.How do you know him, again?Just an old friend. We worked 
together years ago.He clears his throat, breaking my reverie. My grin fades 
into a small, restrained smile.You top up his glass.The conversation drifts 
into stocks and bonds. My mind begins to wander, like a bored schoolgirl.Your 
hand brushes my leg.Was it an accident? I look at you questioningly, but you 
are staring straight ahead, engrossed in conversation.Then there it is again. 
Very deliberately, resting on my knee.Oh, your hands.They slide up my thigh and 
under my skirt, lightly skimming the fabric of my panties.Its been so long.I 
part my legs under the table.The conversation turns to politics.A mirror 
effect, you say.He looks confused. Whats this about mirrors?The word sends a 
jolt through my body.Your hand slips into my panties.


Poker Face
There was a time I would tell you, of all that ached inside; the 
things I held so sacred, to all the world I'd hide. 
But they became your weapons, and slowly I 
have learnt, the less that is said, the better the lesser Ill be hurt. Of all 
youve used against me,  the worst has been my words. There are things Ill never 
tell you, and it is sad to think it so; the more you come to know me the less 
of me youll know. 


A Ghost 
His voice in this room, like shadows on walls; I imagine him on  the 
other side of the door. His voice, his hands, his touch, at the start, 
the end,  and  in the middle.
Strange how it mattered so much, when now it matters  so little.


Her Words 
Love a girl who writes and live her many lives; you have yet to find
her, beneath her words of guise. Kiss her blue-inked fingers, forgive the pens 
they marked. The stain of your lips upon her the one she cant discard.Forget 
her tattered memories, or the pages others took; you are her ever after the 
hero of her book.

History In the beginning, I wrote to you and you wrote back. For the first 
time, I had
something worth writing about.Then somewhere during our correspondence, I 
deviatedand instead of writing to you, I began writing for you. There was so 
much to say, things I couldnt tell you and I sensed it was important to put 
them down somewhere. For inherently, mankind is compelled to record their 
greatest moments in history and you were mine. I dont write to you anymore. Nor 
do I write for you. But I do writeand every word still aches for you. 


The Dream
I saw a dream long lost to me, in search of  anothers waking.
It found a shoreline
far away  as the day as my heart, was breaking. And I sighed and wept  for what 
could not be and for all that could  have been, For every hope and every prayer  
long drowned  beneath the sea. I fell to sleep  alone that night,  to the sound 
of a distant call.The faintest whisper  of good-bye and the dream  was mine, no 
more.


The End 
I dont know what to say, he said. Its okay, she replied, I know what we
areand I know what were not. 


A Sad Farewell 
For all the time Ive known you, to the presentnow our past; I 
know never to forget you; though regret still pains my heart.
Had I known, I would not have 
left you, alone beneath those stars, on the night when I last saw you, not 
knowing it was the last. 


Unrequited The sun above; a stringless kite, her tendril fingers reach 
toward.Her eyes, like flowers, close at night,
and the moon is sad to be ignored.










Crosswords
I write to bring you closer. To imagine your fingers trailing the 
curve of my spine. To recall
how the span of your hands were exactly the width of my hips. And how our 
bodies would fall into each other like words on a crossword puzzle. I write for 
the raw ache in my bones when the ink seeps into paperfor the bittersweet 
sorrow that comes from bringing you back. 


Entwined
There is a line Im yet to sever  it goes from me  to you.There was
a time you swore forever, and I am captive to its pull.If you were kind, youd 
cut the tether but I must ask you to be cruel.


Shipwrecks
The wild seas for which she longed, lay far beyond  the shore. The 
shipwreck that her
lips had sung, meant she never  left at all. It wasnt til  the tide had won,  
that she learned it could not hurt her. It was the furthest  she had gone and 
she never went  much further.


Thoughts 
Dawn turns to day,  as stars are dispersed; wherever I lay, I think of 
you first.
The sun has arisen,  the sky, a sad blue. I quietly listen the wind sings of 
you.The thoughts we each keep, that are closest to heart, we think as we sleep 
and youre always my last. 


Dead Poets
Her poetry is written on the ghost of trees, whispered on the lips of 
lovers. As a
little girl, she would drift in and out of libraries filled with dead poets and 
their musky scent. She held them in her hands and breathed them inwanting so 
much to be part of their world. It wasnt long before Emily began speaking to 
her, then Sylvia and Katherine; their voices rang in unison, haunting and 
beautiful. They told her one day her poetry would be written on the ghost of 
trees and whispered on the lips of lovers. But it would come at a price. There 
isnt a thing I would not gladly give, she thought, to join my idols on those 
dusty shelves. To be immortal. As if reading her mind, the voices of the dead 
poets cried out in alarm and warned her about the greatest heartache of allhow 
every stroke of pen thereafter would open the same wound over and over 
again.What is the cause of such great heartache? She asked. They heard the keen 
anticipation in her voice and were sorry for her. The greatest heartache comes 
from loving another soul, they said, beyond reason, beyond doubt, with no hope 
of salvation. It was on her sixteenth birthday that she first fell in love. 
With a boy who brought her red roses and white lies. When he broke her heart, 
she cried for days. Then hopeful, she sat with a pen in her hand, poised over 
the blank white sheet, but it refused to draw blood. Many birthdays came and 
went. One by one, she loved them and just as easily, they were lost to her. 
Somewhere amidst the carnations and forget-me-nots, between the lilacs and 
mistletoeshe slowly learned about love. Little by little, her heart bloomed 
into a bouquet of hope and ecstasy, of tenderness and betrayal. Then she met 
you, and you brought her dandelions each day, so she would never want for 
wishes. She looked deep into your eyes and saw the very best of herself 
reflected back. And she loved you, beyond reason, beyond doubt, and with no 
hope of salvation. When she felt your love slipping away from her, she knelt at 
the altar, before all the great poetsand she begged. She no longer cared for 
poetry or immortality, she only wanted you. But all the dead poets could do was 
look on, helpless and resigned while everything she had ever wished for came 
true in the cruelest possible way. She learned too late that poets are among 
the damned, cursed to commiserate over their loss, to reach with outstretched 
handshands that will never know the weight of what they seek.


Hes Forgotten 
Time is to wound like wound is to suture, when she was his past 
and he is her future. 


Regrets
Timing is irrelevant when two people are meant for each other. Its what 
I once believed.But we met
during a time when I was such a mess, when I still had so much to figure out. 
How could I have known how crucial every word, every action was or how losing 
you would be something I would always regret? If only you could have met me 
now, how different it would be. How much I have changed. How I have grown. I 
learned so much from all the mistakes I made with you. I just wish I had made 
them with someone else.


Nostalgia
Do you remember our first day? The fog lifted and all around us were 
trees linking hands, like
children playing.Our first night, when you stood by the door, conflicted, as I 
sat there with my knees tucked under my chin, and smiling.Then rainbows arching 
over and the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen.How the wind howls as the 
sea whispers, I miss you.Come back to me.


Tell 
Me Tell me if you ever cared, if a single thought for me was spared.Tell 
me when
you lie in bed, do you think of something  I once said. Tell me if you hurt at 
all, when someone says  my name with yours.It may have been so long ago, but I 
would give the world to know.


Us 
I love him and he loves me.We spend every moment together. When sleep parts 
us, we often
meet in our dreams. I like to take naps throughout the day. Like a cat, he 
says. He is a cat person. He thinks my eyes are beautiful and strange. He has 
never seen eyes like mine up close before. He says they look at him with 
daggers when he has done something wrong. Like when he forgets to order olives 
on my half of the pizza. He thinks I am especially cute when angry.We argue 
over whose turn it is to put the DVD in the player. Sometimes no one wins and 
we end up watching bad TV. Which is never really a bad thing.He never imagined 
he would be with someone like me. Now, he says, he cant imagine himself with 
anyone else. 

Were kids, arent we? Yes, kids 
with grown-up powers. 


Fairy Tales
When she was a little girl, she went to the school library asking 
for books about princesses.
Youve read every book we have about princesses. In the whole library?Yes.Years 
later, she fell in love. She wrote his name on the inside of her pencil case. 
Hoping he might ask to borrow a pen so she could be found out. In the yard of a 
house where she lived, there was a large oak tree carved with the initials of 
each boy she had ever kissed. She put a cross next to the letters F.P. and 
noticed with a quiet wonder that he shared the same initials as The Frog 
Prince. She loved only him.Like Rapunzel, she grew her hair longer than anyone 
she knew and for nearly a whole summer, she slept and slept and slept. She 
stayed inside until her skin turned a powder white against her blood red lips. 
Each day was spent living and breathing and longing for twisted paths and 
murderous wolves. Youre living in a fantasy, her mother said.You need to wake 
up, her boyfriend told her. But all she could think about was the boy who was 
now just an inscription inside a pencil case and two crooked letters carved 
into an old oak tree. And the fairy tale his lips once left on the ashen 
surface of her skin.


And/Or
I once wrote a book and called it And/Or. It was about choosing between 
either, or having the
option of both. Im not sure why I wrote it. Perhaps it had something to do with 
how I looked at life. My lack of care. My indecision. I wanted everything 
because I didnt want anything enough. Then I met you and it changed me. For 
once in my life, there was something I wanted. So much. For me, that was the 
death of the word, or; because now, there is no other. It was the end of the 
word, and; for I love only you.


The Very Thing
I often wonder why we want so much, to give others the very thing 
that we
were denied. The mother working tirelessly to provide her child with an 
education; the little boy who was bullied in school and is now a Nobel 
Prize-winning advocate for peace. The author who writes happy endings for the 
characters in her book.


More than Love 
Love was cruel,  as I stood proud;  he showed me you  and
I was bowed. He deftly dealt his swiftest blow I fell further than, I was meant 
to go.And he ashamed, of what hed caused, knew from then, that I was yours. 
That he, an echo  and you, the sound I loved you more than love allowed.


Mixed Messages 
The questions you had never asked  were things you were afraid 
to know; everything that
has come to pass, youve made them all up on your own. There are many words you 
never said, that others dreamed you someday would; each of us for all our days 
will live our lives misunderstood. 


Wounded
A bruise is tender but does not last,  it leaves me as  I always was. But
a wound I take much more to heart,  for a scar will always leave its mark. And 
if you should ask which one you are, my answer is you are a scar.





Always with Me
Your love I once surrendered, has never left my mind. My heart is 
just as tender,
as the day I called you mine. I did not take you with me, but you were never 
left behind.


Edgars Gift 
Anything and everything, the two almost the same everything says, 
have it all; anything, one to
claim. If I say, Id give you everything, we know it can never be, but I will 
give you anything I just hope that thing is me.


A Pilgrimage 
Always seeking, each moment fleeting; this is where my soul will 
rest.With you Ive fulfilled, our
destined meeting; my tired hand, against your chest. This is the heart, that 
keeps mine beating these are the eyes that mine know best.





Keys 
Hearts dont have locks, she said.Some do, he replies. There are people who 
give away the key
to theirs for safekeeping. Others are mistrustful and give out several keys, 
just in case. Then there are those who have misplaced them but never cared to 
look. What about your heart, she asked. He smiled.Your words are the key to 
mine, he replied.Never forget your words. 


You
There are people I will never know and their lives will still ensue; those 
that could have loved
me so and Ill never wonder who. Of all the things to come and go, there is no 
one else like you.The things I never think about and the only thing I do. 


Remembering You
 The day you left, I went through all my old journals, 
frantically looking for the first
mention of you. Searching for any details I can no longer recallany morsel of 
information that may have been lost to my subconscious. The memory of you is 
fading, a little at a time, and I can feel myself forgetting. I dont want to 
forget. 


Masquerade 
As a writer, there is an inclination to step inside someone elses 
shoes, to get under their
skin and see the world through their eyes. In many such scenarios, I have 
slipped into these roles with the greatest of easethen out again with the same 
dexterity. That was until I found myself in character, playing the girl who 
falls in love with you. It was then the line between fantasy and reality were 
so blurred that I no longer knew who I was. Yet, there was clearly a point when 
my role was well and truly over. When I had gone above and beyond the required 
word count. Where I had exhausted every new angle or approach there was to 
writing our story. I know its over, I really do. I know it has been for quite 
some time. Its over, yet my heart still feels you. You are a memory to me now, 
but my mind still thinks of you. What we had was finished long agoyet the words 
will not stop flowing. 


My Heart
Perhaps I never loved enough,  If only Id loved much more; I would not 
nearly had
so much, left waiting, for you in store. If I had given away my heart to those 
who came before; it would be safer left in parts but now you have it all.


Grounded 
The little birds  who dream of flight; who gaze into the starry 
night.Their tired wings fold
down and up; they try their best but it is not enough.


Reasons
I wish I knew why he left. What his reasons were. Why he changed his 
mind. For all
these years, I have turned it over in my headall the possibilitiesyet none of 
them make any sense. And then I think, perhaps it was because he never loved 
me. But that makes the least sense of all.


Well Wishes 
My love, are you well, past the sea and the swell, out in the world, where
danger is fraught. Amidst the doom and the gloom, and the hospital rooms, where 
hearts can be bartered and bought. There are words to betray  and the things 
that we say,  can sometimes be snappy and short.Where the strangers we meet, 
take us down one way streets, and forgetting is something were taught.Where 
earthquakes will reign, between terror and planes and colds are so easily 
caught.



When
When every dream  has turned to dust,  and your highest hopes no longer 
soar. When places
you  once yearned to see, grow further away  on distant shores.When every night 
you close your eyes, and long inside  for something more. Remember this  and 
only this, if nothing else you can recallThere was a life a girl once led, 
where you were loved the most of all.


The Professor
A streak of light flashes across the sky. Thick heavy raindrops 
pound the uneven dirt floor, littered
with dried leaves and twigs. She follows closely behind him, clutching an odd 
contraptiona rectangular device attached with a long, squiggly, antenna. You 
were right about the storm, Professor! she yells over the howling wind. Yes, my 
assistant! he cries, voice charged with excitement, as he holds up the long, 
metal conductor. She stumbles over a log as he reaches out to catch her.They 
tumble on the dry grass laughing. He tosses aside the bent, silver coat hanger, 
wrapping his arms around her waist. The little transistor radio falls from her 
hands.The sun peeks through the treetops.She thinks of their first 
conversation. I live by a forest, he said, describing it in such a way that 
when she came to scale those crooked, winding stairs, it was like she had seen 
it a thousand times before. As if it had always been there, waiting to welcome 
her. Like the pretty, sunlit room that remained unfurnished, sitting empty in 
his house, now filled with her paints and brushes.She would fondly call him her 
Frankenstein, this man who was a patchwork of all the things she had ever 
longed for. He gave her such giftsnot the kind that were put in boxes, but the 
sort that filled her with imagination, breathing indescribable happiness into 
her life. One day, he built her a greenhouse. So you can create your little 
monstrous plants, he explained.He showed her how to catch the stray butterflies 
that fluttered from their elusive neighbors, who were rumored to farm them for 
cosmetic use. She would listen in morbid fascination as he described how the 
helpless insects were cruelly dismembered, before their fragile wings were 
crushed and ground into a fine powder. Your lips would look beautiful, painted 
with butterfly wings,he would tease her.Never! shed cry, alarmed. They spent 
much of their days alone, in their peaceful sanctuary, apart from the little 
visitor who came on weekends. When the weather was good, the three of them 
would venture out, past the worn jetty and picnic on their little beach. He 
would watch them proudly, marveling at the startling contrast between the two 
things he loved most in the world. His son with hair of spun gold, playing at 
his favorite rock pool and chattering animatedly in his singsong voice. She, 
with a small, amused smile on her tiny lips, raven hair tousled by the sea 
wind. She was different from anything he had ever known. 


Patience Patience and Love agreed to meet at a set time and place; beneath the 
twenty-third tree in
the olive orchard. Patience arrived promptly and waited. She checked her watch 
every so often but still, there was no sign of Love. Was it the twenty-third 
tree or the fifty-sixth? She wondered and decided to check, just in case. As 
she made her way over to the fifty-sixth tree, Love arrived at twenty-three, 
where Patience was noticeably absent. Love waited and waited before deciding he 
must have the wrong tree and perhaps it was another where they were supposed to 
meet. Meanwhile, Patience had arrived at the fifty-sixth tree, where Love was 
still nowhere to be seen. Both begin to drift aimlessly around the olive 
orchard, almost meeting but never do. Finally, Patience, who was feeling lost 
and resigned, found herself beneath the same tree where she began. She stood 
there for barely a minute when there was a tap on her shoulder. It was Love. 
Where are you? She asked. I have been 
searching all my life. Stop looking for me, Love replied, and I will find you. 


Tsunamis 
Be careful about giving your heart too quickly, I was told. 
Boys only have one thing on
their minds, they cautioned. I dont know if he truly loves mehow can I be sure? 
I cant say with any conviction that he wont break my heartbut how could I have 
stopped him from taking what was already his? He swept in like a tsunami, wave 
after wave, and I didnt stand a chance. All those warnings, all the things they 
tried to prepare me forlost in an instantto the enormity of what I felt.


All There Was 
My greatest lesson learnt, you were mine until you werent.It was 
you who taught me
so, the grace in letting go.The time we had was all there was not a moment 
more. 


Almost 
Do you see how I love him true it could have been you.As for you and your
love for she it could have been me.But we were a maybe, and never a must when 
it should have been us.


Second Chances 
The path from you extending, I could not see its course or the 
closer to you
I was getting, the further from you Id walked. For I was moving in a circle, 
not a line as I had thought the steps I took away from you, were taking me 
towards. 


Perfect
He said to me Youre perfect, and I want you to be mine. But I felt I 
wasnt worthy and to be perfect, Ill need time.I knew it would be worth it, I could be 
better if I tried, then he got tired of waiting and I watched my chance go by.


The Most 
You may not know the reason why,  for a time I wasnt I.There was a
man who came and went,  on him every breath was spent.Im sorry I forgot all 
else it was the most  I ever felt.

The Garden
The curtain, a smoky gray color, drops from the creamy white ceiling. 
Crawling with strange bugs and
eight-legged creatures, from where an ominous fan whirs.His hand reaches for 
the cord. Astring of shiny, black beads that glisten against the bright, early 
evening sun.Flashback to the time he found her in the garden. White cotton 
dress pulled up around her thighs, feet blackened by the rich, lush earth that 
she had just been turning. With an apologetic smile that said, I couldnt help 
myself.


No Other 
There is someone I keep in my heartI love him and no one else. It is
a love that will only die with me. You may ask, death could be some time 
awaywhat if from now to then, you love someone new? Well I can tell you, there 
is only one love. If any person claims to have loved twice in all their 
lifethey have not loved at all. 


A Dream
As the Earth began spinning faster and faster, we floated upwards, hands 
locked tightly together, eyes sad
and bewildered. We watched as our faces grew younger and realized the Earth was 
spinning in reverse, moving us backwards in time. Then we reached a point where 
I no longer knew who you were and I was grasping the hands of a stranger. But I 
didnt let go. And neither did you. 

I had my first dream about you last night. Really? She smiles. What was it about? I dont 
remember exactly, but the whole time I was dreaming, I knew you were mine. 


Nostalgia for Today 
Do you remember what you once said to me?One day you will 
be nostalgic for today. At the time, I couldnt begin to conceive a 
future without you
I believed  with all my heart we were destined for each other. 
And in the back of my mind, 
I always knew Id feel nostalgic for a moment we shared or a memory we 
createdbut not once, not even for a second did I imagine it was you I would be 
nostalgic for. 


Despondency
There was a girl named Despondency, who loved a boy named 
Altruistic, and he loved her in return.
She adored books and he could not read, so they spent most of their time 
wandering through worlds together and in doing so, lived many lives. One day, 
they read the last book there was and decided they would write their own. It 
was a beautiful tale set against a harsh desert with a prince named Mirage as 
the hero. From their wild imaginings, an intricate plot of adventure and 
tragedy unfolded. Altruistic awoke one night to find Despondency sitting at her 
desk, furiously scribbling away in their book. It caught him by surprise for 
until now, she had not written a single word without him.Despondency turned to 
face him, her eyes cast downward. She told him while writing their story, she 
had fallen desperately in love with Prince Mirage and wanted to wander the 
desert in search of him. Altruistic was heartbroken but knew it was in 
Despondencys nature to long for what she couldnt have, just like it was in his 
not to stand in her way. Crying, she begged him to burn the tale of Prince 
Mirage, but he could not bring himself to do it. They said their good-byes and 
she asked him if he would carry their book with him always. He promised he 
would and with one final look, she was swallowed by the swirling desert sands. 
He knew he would never see her again. Epilogue The girl was standing in the 
graveyard by her fathers tombstone when a tall stranger approached. Handing her 
a worn, leather-bound book, he said, Your father wanted you to have this. She 
knew at once it was the book he had carried in his breast pocket, close to his 
heart for all his life. Her fathers inability to read was also something she 
had inherited, and while tracing her fingers over the cover of the book, she 
asked, Can you please tell me what the title is? Grief. the stranger replied.
