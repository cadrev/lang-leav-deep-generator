  <h2 class="calibre7">Lost Things</h2>

  <p class="para">Do you know when you've lost something—like your favorite T-shirt or a set of keys—and while looking for it, you come across something else you once missed but have long since forgotten? Well whatever it was, there was a point where you decided to stop searching, maybe because it was no longer required or a new replacement was found. It is almost as if it never existed in the first place—until that moment of rediscovery, a flash of recognition.</p>

  <p class="para"></p>

  <p class="para">Everyone has one—an inventory of lost things waiting to be found. Yearning to be acknowledged for the worth they once held in your life.</p>

  <p class="para"></p>

  <p class="para">I think this is where I belong—among all your other lost things. A crumpled note at the bottom of a drawer or an old photograph pressed between the pages of a book. I hope someday you will find me and remember what I once meant to you.</p>
